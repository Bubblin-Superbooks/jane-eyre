<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; Long after the little birds had left their nests; long after bees had come in the sweet prime of day to gather the heath honey before the dew was dried&mdash;when the long morning shadows were curtailed, and the sun filled earth and sky&mdash;I got up, and I looked round me.</p><p>What a still, hot, perfect day!&nbsp; What a golden desert this spreading moor!&nbsp; Everywhere sunshine.&nbsp; I wished I could live in it and on it.&nbsp; I saw a lizard run over the crag; I saw a bee busy among the sweet bilberries.&nbsp; I would fain at the moment have become bee or lizard, that I might have found fitting nutriment, permanent shelter here.&nbsp; But I was a human being, and had a human being&rsquo;s wants: I must not linger where there was nothing to supply them.&nbsp; I rose; I looked back at the bed I had left.</p></div> </div>
