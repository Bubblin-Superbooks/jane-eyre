<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>My rest might have been blissful enough, only a sad heart broke it.&nbsp; It plained of its gaping wounds, its inward bleeding, its riven chords.&nbsp; It trembled for Mr. Rochester and his doom; it bemoaned him with bitter pity; it demanded him with ceaseless longing; and, impotent as a bird with both wings broken, it still quivered its shattered pinions in vain attempts to seek him.</p><p>Worn out with this torture of thought, I rose to my knees.&nbsp; Night was come, and her planets were risen: a safe, still night: too serene for the companionship of fear.&nbsp; We know that God is everywhere; but certainly we feel His presence most when His works are on the grandest scale spread before us; and it is in the unclouded night-sky, where His worlds wheel their silent course, that we read clearest His infinitude, His omnipotence, His omnipresence.</p></div> </div>
