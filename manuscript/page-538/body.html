<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Tall, fine bust, sloping shoulders; long, graceful neck: olive complexion, dark and clear; noble features; eyes rather like Mr. Rochester&rsquo;s: large and black, and as brilliant as her jewels.&nbsp; And then she had such a fine head of hair; raven-black and so becomingly arranged: a crown of thick plaits behind, and in front the longest, the glossiest curls I ever saw.&nbsp; She was dressed in pure white; an amber-coloured scarf was passed over her shoulder and across her breast, tied at the side, and descending in long, fringed ends below her knee.&nbsp; She wore an amber-coloured flower, too, in her hair: it contrasted well with the jetty mass of her curls.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She was greatly admired, of course?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
