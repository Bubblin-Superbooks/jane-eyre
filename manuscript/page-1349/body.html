<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>I am afraid the whole of the ensuing week tried his patience.&nbsp; It was Christmas week: we took to no settled employment, but spent it in a sort of merry domestic dissipation.&nbsp; The air of the moors, the freedom of home, the dawn of prosperity, acted on Diana and Mary&rsquo;s spirits like some life-giving elixir: they were gay from morning till noon, and from noon till night.&nbsp; They could always talk; and their discourse, witty, pithy, original, had such charms for me, that I preferred listening to, and sharing in it, to doing anything else.&nbsp; St. John did not rebuke our vivacity; but he escaped from it: he was seldom in the house; his parish was large, the population scattered, and he found daily business in visiting the sick and poor in its different districts.</p></div> </div>
