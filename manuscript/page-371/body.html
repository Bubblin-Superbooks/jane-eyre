<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; I valued what was good in Mrs. Fairfax, and what was good in Ad&egrave;le; but I believed in the existence of other and more vivid kinds of goodness, and what I believed in I wished to behold.</p><p>Who blames me?&nbsp; Many, no doubt; and I shall be called discontented.&nbsp; I could not help it: the restlessness was in my nature; it agitated me to pain sometimes.&nbsp; Then my sole relief was to walk along the corridor of the third storey, backwards and forwards, safe in the silence and solitude of the spot, and allow my mind&rsquo;s eye to dwell on whatever bright visions rose before it&mdash;and, certainly, they were many and glowing; to let my heart be heaved by the exultant movement, which, while it swelled it in trouble, expanded it with life; and, best of all, to open my inward ear to a tale that was never ended&mdash;</p></div> </div>
