<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; Mr. Eshton, the magistrate of the district, is gentleman-like: his hair is quite white, his eyebrows and whiskers still dark, which gives him something of the appearance of a &ldquo;p&egrave;re noble de th&eacute;&acirc;tre.&rdquo;&nbsp; Lord Ingram, like his sisters, is very tall; like them, also, he is handsome; but he shares Mary&rsquo;s apathetic and listless look: he seems to have more length of limb than vivacity of blood or vigour of brain.</p><p>And where is Mr. Rochester?</p><p>He comes in last: I am not looking at the arch, yet I see him enter.&nbsp; I try to concentrate my attention on those netting-needles, on the meshes of the purse I am forming&mdash;I wish to think only of the work I have in my hands, to see only the silver beads and silk threads that lie in my lap; whereas, I distinctly behold his figure, and I inevitably recall the moment when I last saw it;</p></div> </div>
