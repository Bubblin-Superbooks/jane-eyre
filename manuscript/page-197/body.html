<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; We are, and must be, one and all, burdened with faults in this world: but the time will soon come when, I trust, we shall put them off in putting off our corruptible bodies; when debasement and sin will fall from us with this cumbrous frame of flesh, and only the spark of the spirit will remain,&mdash;the impalpable principle of light and thought, pure as when it left the Creator to inspire the creature: whence it came it will return; perhaps again to be communicated to some being higher than man&mdash;perhaps to pass through gradations of glory, from the pale human soul to brighten to the seraph!&nbsp; Surely it will never, on the contrary, be suffered to degenerate from man to fiend?&nbsp; No; I cannot believe that: I hold another creed: which no one ever taught me, and which I seldom mention; but in which I delight, and to which I cling: for it extends hope to all: it makes Eternity a rest&mdash;</p></div> </div>
