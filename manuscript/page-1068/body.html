<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; Last January, rid of all mistresses&mdash;in a harsh, bitter frame of mind, the result of a useless, roving, lonely life&mdash;corroded with disappointment, sourly disposed against all men, and especially against all womankind (for I began to regard the notion of an intellectual, faithful, loving woman as a mere dream), recalled by business, I came back to England.</p><p>&ldquo;On a frosty winter afternoon, I rode in sight of Thornfield Hall.&nbsp; Abhorred spot!&nbsp; I expected no peace&mdash;no pleasure there.&nbsp; On a stile in Hay Lane I saw a quiet little figure sitting by itself.&nbsp; I passed it as negligently as I did the pollard willow opposite to it: I had no presentiment of what it would be to me; no inward warning that the arbitress of my life&mdash;my genius for good or evil&mdash;waited there in humble guise.</p></div> </div>
