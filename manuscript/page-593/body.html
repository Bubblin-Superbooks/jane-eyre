<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Coffee is handed.&nbsp; The ladies, since the gentlemen entered, have become lively as larks; conversation waxes brisk and merry.&nbsp; Colonel Dent and Mr. Eshton argue on politics; their wives listen.&nbsp; The two proud dowagers, Lady Lynn and Lady Ingram, confabulate together.&nbsp; Sir George&mdash;whom, by-the-bye, I have forgotten to describe,&mdash;a very big, and very fresh-looking country gentleman, stands before their sofa, coffee-cup in hand, and occasionally puts in a word.&nbsp; Mr. Frederick Lynn has taken a seat beside Mary Ingram, and is showing her the engravings of a splendid volume: she looks, smiles now and then, but apparently says little.&nbsp; The tall and phlegmatic Lord Ingram leans with folded arms on the chair-back of the little and lively Amy Eshton; she glances up at him, and chatters like a wren: she likes him better than she does Mr. Rochester.</p></div> </div>
