<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>I drew near houses; I left them, and came back again, and again I wandered away: always repelled by the consciousness of having no claim to ask&mdash;no right to expect interest in my isolated lot.&nbsp; Meantime, the afternoon advanced, while I thus wandered about like a lost and starving dog.&nbsp; In crossing a field, I saw the church spire before me: I hastened towards it.&nbsp; Near the churchyard, and in the middle of a garden, stood a well-built though small house, which I had no doubt was the parsonage.&nbsp; I remembered that strangers who arrive at a place where they have no friends, and who want employment, sometimes apply to the clergyman for introduction and aid.&nbsp; It is the clergyman&rsquo;s function to help&mdash;at least with advice&mdash;those who wished to help themselves.&nbsp; I seemed to have something like a right to seek counsel here.</p></div> </div>
