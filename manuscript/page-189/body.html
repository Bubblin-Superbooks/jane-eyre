<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Is Miss Temple as severe to you as Miss Scatcherd?&rdquo;</p><p>At the utterance of Miss Temple&rsquo;s name, a soft smile flitted over her grave face.</p><p>&ldquo;Miss Temple is full of goodness; it pains her to be severe to any one, even the worst in the school: she sees my errors, and tells me of them gently; and, if I do anything worthy of praise, she gives me my meed liberally.&nbsp; One strong proof of my wretchedly defective nature is, that even her expostulations, so mild, so rational, have not influence to cure me of my faults; and even her praise, though I value it most highly, cannot stimulate me to continued care and foresight.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
