<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Yet how well you replied this afternoon.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It was mere chance; the subject on which we had been reading had interested me.&nbsp; This afternoon, instead of dreaming of Deepden, I was wondering how a man who wished to do right could act so unjustly and unwisely as Charles the First sometimes did; and I thought what a pity it was that, with his integrity and conscientiousness, he could see no farther than the prerogatives of the crown.&nbsp; If he had but been able to look to a distance, and see how what they call the spirit of the age was tending!&nbsp; Still, I like Charles&mdash;I respect him&mdash;I pity him, poor murdered king!&nbsp; Yes, his enemies were the worst: they shed blood they had no right to shed.&nbsp; How dared they kill him!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
