<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>A puerile tear dimmed my eye while I looked&mdash;a tear of disappointment and impatience; ashamed of it, I wiped it away.&nbsp; I lingered; the moon shut herself wholly within her chamber, and drew close her curtain of dense cloud: the night grew dark; rain came driving fast on the gale.</p><p>&ldquo;I wish he would come!&nbsp; I wish he would come!&rdquo; I exclaimed, seized with hypochondriac foreboding.&nbsp; I had expected his arrival before tea; now it was dark: what could keep him?&nbsp; Had an accident happened?&nbsp; The event of last night again recurred to me.&nbsp; I interpreted it as a warning of disaster.&nbsp; I feared my hopes were too bright to be realised; and I had enjoyed so much bliss lately that I imagined my fortune had passed its meridian, and must now decline.</p></div> </div>
