<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; I knew, by instinct, how the matter stood, before St. John had said another word; but I cannot expect the reader to have the same intuitive perception, so I must repeat his explanation.</p><p>&ldquo;My mother&rsquo;s name was Eyre; she had two brothers; one a clergyman, who married Miss Jane Reed, of Gateshead; the other, John Eyre, Esq., merchant, late of Funchal, Madeira.&nbsp; Mr. Briggs, being Mr. Eyre&rsquo;s solicitor, wrote to us last August to inform us of our uncle&rsquo;s death, and to say that he had left his property to his brother the clergyman&rsquo;s orphan daughter, overlooking us, in consequence of a quarrel, never forgiven, between him and my father.&nbsp; He wrote again a few weeks since, to intimate that the heiress was lost, and asking if we knew anything of her.&nbsp; A name casually written on a slip of paper has enabled me to find her out.&nbsp; You know the rest.&rdquo;&nbsp; Again he was going, but I set my back against the door.</p></div> </div>
