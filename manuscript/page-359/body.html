<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; Leaning over the battlements and looking far down, I surveyed the grounds laid out like a map: the bright and velvet lawn closely girdling the grey base of the mansion; the field, wide as a park, dotted with its ancient timber; the wood, dun and sere, divided by a path visibly overgrown, greener with moss than the trees were with foliage; the church at the gates, the road, the tranquil hills, all reposing in the autumn day&rsquo;s sun; the horizon bounded by a propitious sky, azure, marbled with pearly white.&nbsp; No feature in the scene was extraordinary, but all was pleasing.&nbsp; When I turned from it and repassed the trap-door, I could scarcely see my way down the ladder; the attic seemed black as a vault compared with that arch of blue air to which I had been looking up, and to that sunlit scene of grove, pasture, and green hill, of which the hall was the centre, and over which I had been gazing with delight.</p></div> </div>
