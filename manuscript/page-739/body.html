<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;I like to serve you, sir, and to obey you in all that is right.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Precisely: I see you do.&nbsp; I see genuine contentment in your gait and mien, your eye and face, when you are helping me and pleasing me&mdash;working for me, and with me, in, as you characteristically say, &lsquo;all that is right:&rsquo; for if I bid you do what you thought wrong, there would be no light-footed running, no neat-handed alacrity, no lively glance and animated complexion.&nbsp; My friend would then turn to me, quiet and pale, and would say, &lsquo;No, sir; that is impossible: I cannot do it, because it is wrong;&rsquo; and would become immutable as a fixed star.&nbsp; Well, you too have power over me, and may injure me: yet I dare not show you where I am vulnerable, lest, faithful and friendly as you are, you should transfix me at once.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
