<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like you so well as I have done sometimes, indeed, sir.&nbsp; Did it not seem to you in the least wrong to live in that way, first with one mistress and then another?&nbsp; You talk of it as a mere matter of course.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It was with me; and I did not like it.&nbsp; It was a grovelling fashion of existence: I should never like to return to it.&nbsp; Hiring a mistress is the next worse thing to buying a slave: both are often by nature, and always by position, inferior: and to live familiarly with inferiors is degrading.&nbsp; I now hate the recollection of the time I passed with C&eacute;line, Giacinta, and Clara.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
