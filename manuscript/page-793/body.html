<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Provided with a case of pencils, and some sheets of paper, I used to take a seat apart from them, near the window, and busy myself in sketching fancy vignettes, representing any scene that happened momentarily to shape itself in the ever-shifting kaleidoscope of imagination: a glimpse of sea between two rocks; the rising moon, and a ship crossing its disk; a group of reeds and water-flags, and a naiad&rsquo;s head, crowned with lotus-flowers, rising out of them; an elf sitting in a hedge-sparrow&rsquo;s nest, under a wreath of hawthorn-bloom.</p><p>One morning I fell to sketching a face: what sort of a face it was to be, I did not care or know.&nbsp; I took a soft black pencil, gave it a broad point, and worked away.</p></div> </div>
