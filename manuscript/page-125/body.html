<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; I leaned against a gate, and looked into an empty field where no sheep were feeding, where the short grass was nipped and blanched.&nbsp; It was a very grey day; a most opaque sky, &ldquo;onding on snaw,&rdquo; canopied all; thence flakes felt it intervals, which settled on the hard path and on the hoary lea without melting.&nbsp; I stood, a wretched child enough, whispering to myself over and over again, &ldquo;What shall I do?&mdash;what shall I do?&rdquo;</p><p>All at once I heard a clear voice call, &ldquo;Miss Jane! where are you?&nbsp; Come to lunch!&rdquo;</p><p>It was Bessie, I knew well enough; but I did not stir; her light step came tripping down the path.</p></div> </div>
