<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; I looked up&mdash;I was supported by Mr. Rochester, who sat in a chair across my chamber threshold.</p><p>&ldquo;You come out at last,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, I have been waiting for you long, and listening: yet not one movement have I heard, nor one sob: five minutes more of that death-like hush, and I should have forced the lock like a burglar.&nbsp; So you shun me?&mdash;you shut yourself up and grieve alone!&nbsp; I would rather you had come and upbraided me with vehemence.&nbsp; You are passionate.&nbsp; I expected a scene of some kind.&nbsp; I was prepared for the hot rain of tears; only I wanted them to be shed on my breast: now a senseless floor has received them, or your drenched handkerchief.&nbsp; But I err: you have not wept at all!&nbsp; I see a white cheek and a faded eye, but no trace of tears.&nbsp; I suppose, then, your heart has been weeping blood?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
