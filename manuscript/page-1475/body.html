<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>I proceeded: at last my way opened, the trees thinned a little; presently I beheld a railing, then the house&mdash;scarce, by this dim light, distinguishable from the trees; so dank and green were its decaying walls.&nbsp; Entering a portal, fastened only by a latch, I stood amidst a space of enclosed ground, from which the wood swept away in a semicircle.&nbsp; There were no flowers, no garden-beds; only a broad gravel-walk girdling a grass-plat, and this set in the heavy frame of the forest.&nbsp; The house presented two pointed gables in its front; the windows were latticed and narrow: the front door was narrow too, one step led up to it.&nbsp; The whole looked, as the host of the Rochester Arms had said, &ldquo;quite a desolate spot.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was as still as a church on a week-day: the pattering rain on the forest leaves was the only sound audible in its vicinage.</p></div> </div>
