<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>A splendid Midsummer shone over England: skies so pure, suns so radiant as were then seen in long succession, seldom favour even singly, our wave-girt land.&nbsp; It was as if a band of Italian days had come from the South, like a flock of glorious passenger birds, and lighted to rest them on the cliffs of Albion.&nbsp; The hay was all got in; the fields round Thornfield were green and shorn; the roads white and baked; the trees were in their dark prime; hedge and wood, full-leaved and deeply tinted, contrasted well with the sunny hue of the cleared meadows between.</p><p>On Midsummer-eve, Ad&egrave;le, weary with gathering wild strawberries in Hay Lane half the day, had gone to bed with the sun.&nbsp; I watched her drop asleep, and when I left her, I sought the garden.</p></div> </div>
