<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Mrs. Colonel Dent was less showy; but, I thought, more lady-like.&nbsp; She had a slight figure, a pale, gentle face, and fair hair.&nbsp; Her black satin dress, her scarf of rich foreign lace, and her pearl ornaments, pleased me better than the rainbow radiance of the titled dame.</p><p>But the three most distinguished&mdash;partly, perhaps, because the tallest figures of the band&mdash;were the Dowager Lady Ingram and her daughters, Blanche and Mary.&nbsp; They were all three of the loftiest stature of women.&nbsp; The Dowager might be between forty and fifty: her shape was still fine; her hair (by candle-light at least) still black; her teeth, too, were still apparently perfect.&nbsp; Most people would have termed her a splendid woman of her age: and so she was, no doubt, physically speaking; but then there was an expression of almost insupportable haughtiness in her bearing and countenance.</p></div> </div>
