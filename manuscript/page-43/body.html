<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>This room was chill, because it seldom had a fire; it was silent, because remote from the nursery and kitchen; solemn, because it was known to be so seldom entered.&nbsp; The house-maid alone came here on Saturdays, to wipe from the mirrors and the furniture a week&rsquo;s quiet dust: and Mrs. Reed herself, at far intervals, visited it to review the contents of a certain secret drawer in the wardrobe, where were stored divers parchments, her jewel-casket, and a miniature of her deceased husband; and in those last words lies the secret of the red-room&mdash;the spell which kept it so lonely in spite of its grandeur.</p><p>Mr. Reed had been dead nine years: it was in this chamber he breathed his last; here he lay in state; hence his coffin was borne by the undertaker&rsquo;s men; and, since that day, a sense of dreary consecration had guarded it from frequent intrusion.</p></div> </div>
