<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>I was not surprised, when I ran down into the hall, to see that a brilliant June morning had succeeded to the tempest of the night; and to feel, through the open glass door, the breathing of a fresh and fragrant breeze.&nbsp; Nature must be gladsome when I was so happy.&nbsp; A beggar-woman and her little boy&mdash;pale, ragged objects both&mdash;were coming up the walk, and I ran down and gave them all the money I happened to have in my purse&mdash;some three or four shillings: good or bad, they must partake of my jubilee.&nbsp; The rooks cawed, and blither birds sang; but nothing was so merry or so musical as my own rejoicing heart.</p></div> </div>
