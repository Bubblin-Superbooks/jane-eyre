<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>might relax this forced action, and, sitting down on a stone I saw near, submit resistlessly to the apathy that clogged heart and limb&mdash;I heard a bell chime&mdash;a church bell.</p><p>I turned in the direction of the sound, and there, amongst the romantic hills, whose changes and aspect I had ceased to note an hour ago, I saw a hamlet and a spire.&nbsp; All the valley at my right hand was full of pasture-fields, and cornfields, and wood; and a glittering stream ran zig-zag through the varied shades of green, the mellowing grain, the sombre woodland, the clear and sunny lea.&nbsp; Recalled by the rumbling of wheels to the road before me, I saw a heavily-laden waggon labouring up the hill, and not far beyond were two cows and their drover.&nbsp; Human life and human labour were near.&nbsp; I must struggle on: strive to live and bend to toil like the rest.</p></div> </div>
