<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;This life,&rsquo; said I at last, &lsquo;is hell: this is the air&mdash;those are the sounds of the bottomless pit!&nbsp; I have a right to deliver myself from it if I can.&nbsp; The sufferings of this mortal state will leave me with the heavy flesh that now cumbers my soul.&nbsp; Of the fanatic&rsquo;s burning eternity I have no fear: there is not a future state worse than this present one&mdash;let me break away, and go home to God!&rsquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I said this whilst I knelt down at, and unlocked a trunk which contained a brace of loaded pistols: I mean to shoot myself.&nbsp; I only entertained the intention for a moment; for, not being insane, the crisis of exquisite and unalloyed despair, which had originated the wish and design of self-destruction, was past in a second.</p></div> </div>
