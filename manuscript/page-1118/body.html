<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; A mild-looking, cleanly-attired young woman opened the door.&nbsp; In such a voice as might be expected from a hopeless heart and fainting frame&mdash;a voice wretchedly low and faltering&mdash;I asked if a servant was wanted here?</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;we do not keep a servant.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Can you tell me where I could get employment of any kind?&rdquo; I continued.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am a stranger, without acquaintance in this place.&nbsp; I want some work: no matter what.&rdquo;</p><p>But it was not her business to think for me, or to seek a place for me: besides, in her eyes, how doubtful must have appeared my character, position, tale.&nbsp; She shook her head, she &ldquo;was sorry she could give me no information,&rdquo; and the white door closed, quite gently and civilly: but it shut me out.</p></div> </div>
