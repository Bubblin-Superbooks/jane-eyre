<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>And I sank down where I stood, and hid my face against the ground.&nbsp; I lay still a while: the night-wind swept over the hill and over me, and died moaning in the distance; the rain fell fast, wetting me afresh to the skin.&nbsp; Could I but have stiffened to the still frost&mdash;the friendly numbness of death&mdash;it might have pelted on; I should not have felt it; but my yet living flesh shuddered at its chilling influence.&nbsp; I rose ere long.</p><p>The light was yet there, shining dim but constant through the rain.&nbsp; I tried to walk again: I dragged my exhausted limbs slowly towards it.&nbsp; It led me aslant over the hill, through a wide bog, which would have been impassable in winter, and was splashy and shaking even now, in the height of summer.&nbsp; Here I fell twice; but as often I rose and rallied my faculties.&nbsp; This light was my forlorn hope: I must gain it.</p></div> </div>
