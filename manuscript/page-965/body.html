<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; I wandered, on a moonlight night, through the grass-grown enclosure within: here I stumbled over a marble hearth, and there over a fallen fragment of cornice.&nbsp; Wrapped up in a shawl, I still carried the unknown little child: I might not lay it down anywhere, however tired were my arms&mdash;however much its weight impeded my progress, I must retain it.&nbsp; I heard the gallop of a horse at a distance on the road; I was sure it was you; and you were departing for many years and for a distant country.&nbsp; I climbed the thin wall with frantic perilous haste, eager to catch one glimpse of you from the top: the stones rolled from under my feet, the ivy branches I grasped gave way, the child clung round my neck in terror, and almost strangled me; at last I gained the summit.&nbsp; I saw you like a speck on a white track, lessening every moment.&nbsp; The blast blew so strong I could not stand.</p></div> </div>
