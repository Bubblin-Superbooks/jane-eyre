<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Reader, though I look comfortably accommodated, I am not very tranquil in my mind.&nbsp; I thought when the coach stopped here there would be some one to meet me; I looked anxiously round as I descended the wooden steps the &ldquo;boots&rdquo; placed for my convenience, expecting to hear my name pronounced, and to see some description of carriage waiting to convey me to Thornfield.&nbsp; Nothing of the sort was visible; and when I asked a waiter if any one had been to inquire after a Miss Eyre, I was answered in the negative: so I had no resource but to request to be shown into a private room: and here I am waiting, while all sorts of doubts and fears are troubling my thoughts.</p></div> </div>
