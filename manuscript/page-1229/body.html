<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>My home, then, when I at last find a home,&mdash;is a cottage; a little room with whitewashed walls and a sanded floor, containing four painted chairs and a table, a clock, a cupboard, with two or three plates and dishes, and a set of tea-things in delf.&nbsp; Above, a chamber of the same dimensions as the kitchen, with a deal bedstead and chest of drawers; small, yet too large to be filled with my scanty wardrobe: though the kindness of my gentle and generous friends has increased that, by a modest stock of such things as are necessary.</p><p>It is evening.&nbsp; I have dismissed, with the fee of an orange, the little orphan who serves me as a handmaid.&nbsp; I am sitting alone on the hearth.&nbsp; This morning, the village school opened.&nbsp; I had twenty scholars.&nbsp; But three of the number can read: none write or cipher.</p></div> </div>
