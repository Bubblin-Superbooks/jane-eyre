<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Her coming was my hope each day, &nbsp;&nbsp; Her parting was my pain; The chance that did her steps delay &nbsp;&nbsp; Was ice in every vein.</p><p>I dreamed it would be nameless bliss, &nbsp;&nbsp; As I loved, loved to be; And to this object did I press &nbsp;&nbsp; As blind as eagerly.</p><p>But wide as pathless was the space &nbsp;&nbsp; That lay our lives between, And dangerous as the foamy race &nbsp;&nbsp; Of ocean-surges green.</p><p>And haunted as a robber-path &nbsp;&nbsp; Through wilderness or wood; For Might and Right, and Woe and Wrath, &nbsp;&nbsp; Between our spirits stood.</p></div> </div>
