<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; On Thursday afternoons (half-holidays) we now took walks, and found still sweeter flowers opening by the wayside, under the hedges.</p><p>I discovered, too, that a great pleasure, an enjoyment which the horizon only bounded, lay all outside the high and spike-guarded walls of our garden: this pleasure consisted in prospect of noble summits girdling a great hill-hollow, rich in verdure and shadow; in a bright beck, full of dark stones and sparkling eddies.&nbsp; How different had this scene looked when I viewed it laid out beneath the iron sky of winter, stiffened in frost, shrouded with snow!&mdash;when mists as chill as death wandered to the impulse of east winds along those purple peaks, and rolled down &ldquo;ing&rdquo; and holm till they blended with the frozen fog of the beck!&nbsp;</p></div> </div>
