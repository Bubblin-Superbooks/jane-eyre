<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The din was on the causeway: a horse was coming; the windings of the lane yet hid it, but it approached.&nbsp; I was just leaving the stile; yet, as the path was narrow, I sat still to let it go by.&nbsp; In those days I was young, and all sorts of fancies bright and dark tenanted my mind: the memories of nursery stories were there amongst other rubbish; and when they recurred, maturing youth added to them a vigour and vividness beyond what childhood could give.&nbsp; As this horse approached, and as I watched for it to appear through the dusk, I remembered certain of Bessie&rsquo;s tales, wherein figured a North-of-England spirit called a &ldquo;Gytrash,&rdquo; which, in the form of horse, mule, or large dog, haunted solitary ways, and sometimes came upon belated travellers, as this horse was now coming upon me.</p></div> </div>
