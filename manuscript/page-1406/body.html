<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>All this was torture to me&mdash;refined, lingering torture.&nbsp; It kept up a slow fire of indignation and a trembling trouble of grief, which harassed and crushed me altogether.&nbsp; I felt how&mdash;if I were his wife, this good man, pure as the deep sunless source, could soon kill me, without drawing from my veins a single drop of blood, or receiving on his own crystal conscience the faintest stain of crime.&nbsp; Especially I felt this when I made any attempt to propitiate him.&nbsp; No ruth met my ruth.&nbsp; He experienced no suffering from estrangement&mdash;no yearning after reconciliation; and though, more than once, my fast falling tears blistered the page over which we both bent, they produced no more effect on him than if his heart had been really a matter of stone or metal.</p></div> </div>
