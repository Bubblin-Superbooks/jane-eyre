<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The recollection of about three days and nights succeeding this is very dim in my mind.&nbsp; I can recall some sensations felt in that interval; but few thoughts framed, and no actions performed.&nbsp; I knew I was in a small room and in a narrow bed.&nbsp; To that bed I seemed to have grown; I lay on it motionless as a stone; and to have torn me from it would have been almost to kill me.&nbsp; I took no note of the lapse of time&mdash;of the change from morning to noon, from noon to evening.&nbsp; I observed when any one entered or left the apartment: I could even tell who they were; I could understand what was said when the speaker stood near to me; but I could not answer; to open my lips or move my limbs was equally impossible.&nbsp; Hannah, the servant, was my most frequent visitor.&nbsp; Her coming disturbed me.</p></div> </div>
