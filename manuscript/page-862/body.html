<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;I grieve to leave Thornfield: I love Thornfield:&mdash;I love it, because I have lived in it a full and delightful life,&mdash;momentarily at least.&nbsp; I have not been trampled on.&nbsp; I have not been petrified.&nbsp; I have not been buried with inferior minds, and excluded from every glimpse of communion with what is bright and energetic and high.&nbsp; I have talked, face to face, with what I reverence, with what I delight in,&mdash;with an original, a vigorous, an expanded mind.&nbsp; I have known you, Mr. Rochester; and it strikes me with terror and anguish to feel I absolutely must be torn from you for ever.&nbsp; I see the necessity of departure; and it is like looking on the necessity of death.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
