<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; My eye passed all other objects to rest on those most remote, the blue peaks; it was those I longed to surmount; all within their boundary of rock and heath seemed prison-ground, exile limits.&nbsp; I traced the white road winding round the base of one mountain, and vanishing in a gorge between two; how I longed to follow it farther!&nbsp; I recalled the time when I had travelled that very road in a coach; I remembered descending that hill at twilight; an age seemed to have elapsed since the day which brought me first to Lowood, and I had never quitted it since.&nbsp; My vacations had all been spent at school: Mrs. Reed had never sent for me to Gateshead; neither she nor any of her family had ever been to visit me.</p></div> </div>
