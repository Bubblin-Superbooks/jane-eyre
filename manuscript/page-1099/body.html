<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; A weakness, beginning inwardly, extending to the limbs, seized me, and I fell: I lay on the ground some minutes, pressing my face to the wet turf.&nbsp; I had some fear&mdash;or hope&mdash;that here I should die: but I was soon up; crawling forwards on my hands and knees, and then again raised to my feet&mdash;as eager and as determined as ever to reach the road.</p><p>When I got there, I was forced to sit to rest me under the hedge; and while I sat, I heard wheels, and saw a coach come on.&nbsp; I stood up and lifted my hand; it stopped.&nbsp; I asked where it was going: the driver named a place a long way off, and where I was sure Mr. Rochester had no connections.&nbsp; I asked for what sum he would take me there; he said thirty shillings; I answered I had but twenty; well, he would try to make it do.</p></div> </div>
