<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>when cold charity must be entreated before I could get a lodging: reluctant sympathy importuned, almost certain repulse incurred, before my tale could be listened to, or one of my wants relieved!</p><p>I touched the heath: it was dry, and yet warm with the heat of the summer day.&nbsp; I looked at the sky; it was pure: a kindly star twinkled just above the chasm ridge.&nbsp; The dew fell, but with propitious softness; no breeze whispered.&nbsp; Nature seemed to me benign and good; I thought she loved me, outcast as I was; and I, who from man could anticipate only mistrust, rejection, insult, clung to her with filial fondness.&nbsp; To-night, at least, I would be her guest, as I was her child: my mother would lodge me without money and without price.&nbsp; I had one morsel of bread yet: the remnant of a roll I had bought in a town we passed through at noon with a stray penny&mdash;my last coin.</p></div> </div>
