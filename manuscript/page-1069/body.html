<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; I think those day visions were not dark: there was a pleasurable illumination in your eye occasionally, a soft excitement in your aspect, which told of no bitter, bilious, hypochondriac brooding: your look revealed rather the sweet musings of youth when its spirit follows on willing wings the flight of Hope up and on to an ideal heaven.&nbsp; The voice of Mrs. Fairfax, speaking to a servant in the hall, wakened you: and how curiously you smiled to and at yourself, Janet!&nbsp; There was much sense in your smile: it was very shrewd, and seemed to make light of your own abstraction.&nbsp; It seemed to say&mdash;&lsquo;My fine visions are all very well, but I must not forget they are absolutely unreal.&nbsp; I have a rosy sky and a green flowery Eden in my brain; but without, I am perfectly aware, lies at my feet a rough tract to travel, and around me gather black tempests to encounter.</p></div> </div>
