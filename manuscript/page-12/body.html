<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Why have I alluded to this man?&nbsp; I have alluded to him, Reader, because I think I see in him an intellect profounder and more unique than his contemporaries have yet recognised; because I regard him as the first social regenerator of the day&mdash;as the very master of that working corps who would restore to rectitude the warped system of things; because I think no commentator on his writings has yet found the comparison that suits him, the terms which rightly characterise his talent.&nbsp; They say he is like Fielding: they talk of his wit, humour, comic powers.&nbsp; He resembles Fielding as an eagle does a vulture: Fielding could stoop on carrion, but Thackeray never does.&nbsp; His wit is bright, his humour attractive, but both bear the same relation to his serious genius that the mere lambent sheet-lightning playing under the edge of the summer-cloud does to the electric death-spark hid in its womb.</p></div> </div>
