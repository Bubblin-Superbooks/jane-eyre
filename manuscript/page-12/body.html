<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>These things and deeds are diametrically opposed: they are as distinct as is vice from virtue.&nbsp; Men too often confound them: they should not be confounded: appearance should not be mistaken for truth; narrow human doctrines, that only tend to elate and magnify a few, should not be substituted for the world-redeeming creed of Christ.&nbsp; There is&mdash;I repeat it&mdash;a difference; and it is a good, and not a bad action to mark broadly and clearly the line of separation between them.</p><p>The world may not like to see these ideas dissevered, for it has been accustomed to blend them; finding it convenient to make external show pass for sterling worth&mdash;to let white-washed walls vouch for clean shrines.&nbsp; It may hate him who dares to scrutinise and expose&mdash;to rase the gilding, and show base metal under it&mdash;to penetrate the sepulchre, and reveal charnel relics: but hate as it will, it is indebted to him.</p></div> </div>
