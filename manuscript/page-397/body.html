<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>I hastened to Mrs. Fairfax&rsquo;s room; there was a fire there too, but no candle, and no Mrs. Fairfax.&nbsp; Instead, all alone, sitting upright on the rug, and gazing with gravity at the blaze, I beheld a great black and white long-haired dog, just like the Gytrash of the lane.&nbsp; It was so like it that I went forward and said&mdash;&ldquo;Pilot&rdquo; and the thing got up and came to me and snuffed me.&nbsp; I caressed him, and he wagged his great tail; but he looked an eerie creature to be alone with, and I could not tell whence he had come.&nbsp; I rang the bell, for I wanted a candle; and I wanted, too, to get an account of this visitant.&nbsp; Leah entered.</p></div> </div>
