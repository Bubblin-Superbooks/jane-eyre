<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; I now inform you that she is my wife, whom I married fifteen years ago,&mdash;Bertha Mason by name; sister of this resolute personage, who is now, with his quivering limbs and white cheeks, showing you what a stout heart men may bear.&nbsp; Cheer up, Dick!&mdash;never fear me!&mdash;I&rsquo;d almost as soon strike a woman as you.&nbsp; Bertha Mason is mad; and she came of a mad family; idiots and maniacs through three generations!&nbsp; Her mother, the Creole, was both a madwoman and a drunkard!&mdash;as I found out after I had wed the daughter: for they were silent on family secrets before.&nbsp; Bertha, like a dutiful child, copied her parent in both points.&nbsp; I had a charming partner&mdash;pure, wise, modest: you can fancy I was a happy man.&nbsp; I went through rich scenes!&nbsp; Oh! my experience has been heavenly, if you only knew it!&nbsp; But I owe you no further explanation.</p></div> </div>
