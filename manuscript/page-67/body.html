<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;In the days when we went gipsying, &nbsp;&nbsp; A long time ago.&rdquo;</p><p>I had often heard the song before, and always with lively delight; for Bessie had a sweet voice,&mdash;at least, I thought so.&nbsp; But now, though her voice was still sweet, I found in its melody an indescribable sadness.&nbsp; Sometimes, preoccupied with her work, she sang the refrain very low, very lingeringly; &ldquo;A long time ago&rdquo; came out like the saddest cadence of a funeral hymn.&nbsp; She passed into another ballad, this time a really doleful one.</p><p>&ldquo;My feet they are sore, and my limbs they are weary; &nbsp;&nbsp; Long is the way, and the mountains are wild; Soon will the twilight close moonless and dreary &nbsp;&nbsp; Over the path of the poor orphan child.</p></div> </div>
