<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The eventful Thursday at length came.&nbsp; They were expected about dark, and ere dusk fires were lit upstairs and below; the kitchen was in perfect trim; Hannah and I were dressed, and all was in readiness.</p><p>St. John arrived first.&nbsp; I had entreated him to keep quite clear of the house till everything was arranged: and, indeed, the bare idea of the commotion, at once sordid and trivial, going on within its walls sufficed to scare him to estrangement.&nbsp; He found me in the kitchen, watching the progress of certain cakes for tea, then baking.&nbsp; Approaching the hearth, he asked, &ldquo;If I was at last satisfied with housemaid&rsquo;s work?&rdquo;&nbsp; I answered by inviting him to accompany me on a general inspection of the result of my labours.&nbsp; With some difficulty, I got him to make the tour of the house.</p></div> </div>
