<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Ad&egrave;le, look at that field.&rdquo;&nbsp; We were now outside Thornfield gates, and bowling lightly along the smooth road to Millcote, where the dust was well laid by the thunderstorm, and, where the low hedges and lofty timber trees on each side glistened green and rain-refreshed.</p><p>&ldquo;In that field, Ad&egrave;le, I was walking late one evening about a fortnight since&mdash;the evening of the day you helped me to make hay in the orchard meadows; and, as I was tired with raking swaths, I sat down to rest me on a stile; and there I took out a little book and a pencil, and began to write about a misfortune that befell me long ago, and a wish I had for happy days to come: I was writing away very fast, though daylight was fading from the leaf, when something came up the path and stopped two yards off me.&nbsp; I looked at it.&nbsp; It was a little thing with a veil of gossamer on its head.</p></div> </div>
