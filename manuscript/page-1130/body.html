<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Having crossed the marsh, I saw a trace of white over the moor.&nbsp; I approached it; it was a road or a track: it led straight up to the light, which now beamed from a sort of knoll, amidst a clump of trees&mdash;firs, apparently, from what I could distinguish of the character of their forms and foliage through the gloom.&nbsp; My star vanished as I drew near: some obstacle had intervened between me and it.&nbsp; I put out my hand to feel the dark mass before me: I discriminated the rough stones of a low wall&mdash;above it, something like palisades, and within, a high and prickly hedge.&nbsp; I groped on.&nbsp; Again a whitish object gleamed before me: it was a gate&mdash;a wicket; it moved on its hinges as I touched it.&nbsp; On each side stood a sable bush-holly or yew.</p></div> </div>
