<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; How could I possibly prefer the spoilt pet of a wealthy family, who would hate her governess as a nuisance, to a lonely little orphan, who leans towards her as a friend?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, that is the light in which you view it!&nbsp; Well, I must go in now; and you too: it darkens.&rdquo;</p><p>But I stayed out a few minutes longer with Ad&egrave;le and Pilot&mdash;ran a race with her, and played a game of battledore and shuttlecock.&nbsp; When we went in, and I had removed her bonnet and coat, I took her on my knee; kept her there an hour, allowing her to prattle as she liked: not rebuking even some little freedoms and trivialities into which she was apt to stray when much noticed, and which betrayed in her a superficiality of character, inherited probably from her mother, hardly congenial to an English mind.</p></div> </div>
