<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The succeeding week seemed long: it came to an end at last, however, like all sublunary things, and once more, towards the close of a pleasant autumn day, I found myself afoot on the road to Lowton.&nbsp; A picturesque track it was, by the way; lying along the side of the beck and through the sweetest curves of the dale: but that day I thought more of the letters, that might or might not be awaiting me at the little burgh whither I was bound, than of the charms of lea and water.</p><p>My ostensible errand on this occasion was to get measured for a pair of shoes; so I discharged that business first, and when it was done, I stepped across the clean and quiet little street from the shoemaker&rsquo;s to the post-office: it was kept by an old dame, who wore horn spectacles on her nose, and black mittens on her hands.</p></div> </div>
