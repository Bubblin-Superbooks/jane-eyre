<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; My Spring is gone, however, but it has left me that French floweret on my hands, which, in some moods, I would fain be rid of.&nbsp; Not valuing now the root whence it sprang; having found that it was of a sort which nothing but gold dust could manure, I have but half a liking to the blossom, especially when it looks so artificial as just now.&nbsp; I keep it and rear it rather on the Roman Catholic principle of expiating numerous sins, great or small, by one good work.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll explain all this some day.&nbsp; Good-night.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
