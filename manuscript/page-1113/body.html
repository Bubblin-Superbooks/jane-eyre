<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>About two o&rsquo;clock p.m. I entered the village.&nbsp; At the bottom of its one street there was a little shop with some cakes of bread in the window.&nbsp; I coveted a cake of bread.&nbsp; With that refreshment I could perhaps regain a degree of energy: without it, it would be difficult to proceed.&nbsp; The wish to have some strength and some vigour returned to me as soon as I was amongst my fellow-beings.&nbsp; I felt it would be degrading to faint with hunger on the causeway of a hamlet.&nbsp; Had I nothing about me I could offer in exchange for one of these rolls?&nbsp; I considered.&nbsp; I had a small silk handkerchief tied round my throat; I had my gloves.&nbsp; I could hardly tell how men and women in extremities of destitution proceeded.&nbsp; I did not know whether either of these articles would be accepted: probably they would not; but I must try.</p></div> </div>
