<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>A mile off, beyond the fields, lay a road which stretched in the contrary direction to Millcote; a road I had never travelled, but often noticed, and wondered where it led: thither I bent my steps.&nbsp; No reflection was to be allowed now: not one glance was to be cast back; not even one forward.&nbsp; Not one thought was to be given either to the past or the future.&nbsp; The first was a page so heavenly sweet&mdash;so deadly sad&mdash;that to read one line of it would dissolve my courage and break down my energy.&nbsp; The last was an awful blank: something like the world when the deluge was gone by.</p><p>I skirted fields, and hedges, and lanes till after sunrise.&nbsp; I believe it was a lovely summer morning: I know my shoes, which I had put on when I left the house, were soon wet with dew.</p></div> </div>
