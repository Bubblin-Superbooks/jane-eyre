<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>I entered the shop: a woman was there.&nbsp; Seeing a respectably-dressed person, a lady as she supposed, she came forward with civility.&nbsp; How could she serve me?&nbsp; I was seized with shame: my tongue would not utter the request I had prepared.&nbsp; I dared not offer her the half-worn gloves, the creased handkerchief: besides, I felt it would be absurd.&nbsp; I only begged permission to sit down a moment, as I was tired.&nbsp; Disappointed in the expectation of a customer, she coolly acceded to my request.&nbsp; She pointed to a seat; I sank into it.&nbsp; I felt sorely urged to weep; but conscious how unseasonable such a manifestation would be, I restrained it.&nbsp; Soon I asked her &ldquo;if there were any dressmaker or plain-workwoman in the village?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
