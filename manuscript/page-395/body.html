<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; Yes, just as much good as it would do a man tired of sitting still in a &ldquo;too easy chair&rdquo; to take a long walk: and just as natural was the wish to stir, under my circumstances, as it would be under his.</p><p>I lingered at the gates; I lingered on the lawn; I paced backwards and forwards on the pavement; the shutters of the glass door were closed; I could not see into the interior; and both my eyes and spirit seemed drawn from the gloomy house&mdash;from the grey-hollow filled with rayless cells, as it appeared to me&mdash;to that sky expanded before me,&mdash;a blue sea absolved from taint of cloud; the moon ascending it in solemn march; her orb seeming to look up as she left the hill-tops, from behind which she had come, far and farther below her, and aspired to the zenith, midnight dark in its fathomless depth and measureless distance;</p></div> </div>
