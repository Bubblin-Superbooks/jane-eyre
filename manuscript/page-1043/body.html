<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; My father said nothing about her money; but he told me Miss Mason was the boast of Spanish Town for her beauty: and this was no lie.&nbsp; I found her a fine woman, in the style of Blanche Ingram: tall, dark, and majestic.&nbsp; Her family wished to secure me because I was of a good race; and so did she.&nbsp; They showed her to me in parties, splendidly dressed.&nbsp; I seldom saw her alone, and had very little private conversation with her.&nbsp; She flattered me, and lavishly displayed for my pleasure her charms and accomplishments.&nbsp; All the men in her circle seemed to admire her and envy me.&nbsp; I was dazzled, stimulated: my senses were excited; and being ignorant, raw, and inexperienced, I thought I loved her.&nbsp; There is no folly so besotted that the idiotic rivalries of society, the prurience, the rashness, the blindness of youth, will not hurry a man to its commission.</p></div> </div>
