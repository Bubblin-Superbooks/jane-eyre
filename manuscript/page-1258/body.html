<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; By nine o&rsquo;clock the next morning I was punctually opening the school; tranquil, settled, prepared for the steady duties of the day.</p><p>Rosamond Oliver kept her word in coming to visit me.&nbsp; Her call at the school was generally made in the course of her morning ride.&nbsp; She would canter up to the door on her pony, followed by a mounted livery servant.&nbsp; Anything more exquisite than her appearance, in her purple habit, with her Amazon&rsquo;s cap of black velvet placed gracefully above the long curls that kissed her cheek and floated to her shoulders, can scarcely be imagined: and it was thus she would enter the rustic building, and glide through the dazzled ranks of the village children.&nbsp; She generally came at the hour when Mr. Rivers was engaged in giving his daily catechising lesson.&nbsp; Keenly, I fear, did the eye of the visitress pierce the young pastor&rsquo;s heart.</p></div> </div>
