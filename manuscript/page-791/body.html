<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;A strange wish, Mrs. Reed; why do you hate her so?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I had a dislike to her mother always; for she was my husband&rsquo;s only sister, and a great favourite with him: he opposed the family&rsquo;s disowning her when she made her low marriage; and when news came of her death, he wept like a simpleton.&nbsp; He would send for the baby; though I entreated him rather to put it out to nurse and pay for its maintenance.&nbsp; I hated it the first time I set my eyes on it&mdash;a sickly, whining, pining thing!&nbsp; It would wail in its cradle all night long&mdash;not screaming heartily like any other child, but whimpering and moaning.&nbsp; Reed pitied it; and he used to nurse it and notice it as if it had been his own: more, indeed, than he ever noticed his own at that age.</p></div> </div>
