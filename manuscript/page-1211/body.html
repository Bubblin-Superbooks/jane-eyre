<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>St. John said these words as he pronounced his sermons, with a quiet, deep voice; with an unflushed cheek, and a coruscating radiance of glance.&nbsp; He resumed&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;And since I am myself poor and obscure, I can offer you but a service of poverty and obscurity.&nbsp; You may even think it degrading&mdash;for I see now your habits have been what the world calls refined: your tastes lean to the ideal, and your society has at least been amongst the educated; but I consider that no service degrades which can better our race.&nbsp; I hold that the more arid and unreclaimed the soil where the Christian labourer&rsquo;s task of tillage is appointed him&mdash;the scantier the meed his toil brings&mdash;the higher the honour.&nbsp; His, under such circumstances, is the destiny of the pioneer; and the first pioneers of the Gospel were the Apostles&mdash;their captain was Jesus, the Redeemer, Himself.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
