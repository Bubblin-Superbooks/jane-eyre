<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; Mr. Rochester is an amateur of the decided and eccentric: Grace is eccentric at least.&nbsp; What if a former caprice (a freak very possible to a nature so sudden and headstrong as his) has delivered him into her power, and she now exercises over his actions a secret influence, the result of his own indiscretion, which he cannot shake off, and dare not disregard?&rdquo;&nbsp; But, having reached this point of conjecture, Mrs. Poole&rsquo;s square, flat figure, and uncomely, dry, even coarse face, recurred so distinctly to my mind&rsquo;s eye, that I thought, &ldquo;No; impossible! my supposition cannot be correct.&nbsp; Yet,&rdquo; suggested the secret voice which talks to us in our own hearts, &ldquo;you are not beautiful either, and perhaps Mr. Rochester approves you: at any rate, you have often felt as if he did; and last night&mdash;remember his words; remember his look; remember his voice!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
