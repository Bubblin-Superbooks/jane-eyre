<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>It was near Christmas by the time all was settled: the season of general holiday approached.&nbsp; I now closed Morton school, taking care that the parting should not be barren on my side.&nbsp; Good fortune opens the hand as well as the heart wonderfully; and to give somewhat when we have largely received, is but to afford a vent to the unusual ebullition of the sensations.&nbsp; I had long felt with pleasure that many of my rustic scholars liked me, and when we parted, that consciousness was confirmed: they manifested their affection plainly and strongly.&nbsp; Deep was my gratification to find I had really a place in their unsophisticated hearts: I promised them that never a week should pass in future that I did not visit them, and give them an hour&rsquo;s teaching in their school.</p></div> </div>
