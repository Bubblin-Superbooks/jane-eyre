<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The month of courtship had wasted: its very last hours were being numbered.&nbsp; There was no putting off the day that advanced&mdash;the bridal day; and all preparations for its arrival were complete.&nbsp; I, at least, had nothing more to do: there were my trunks, packed, locked, corded, ranged in a row along the wall of my little chamber; to-morrow, at this time, they would be far on their road to London: and so should I (D.V.),&mdash;or rather, not I, but one Jane Rochester, a person whom as yet I knew not.&nbsp; The cards of address alone remained to nail on: they lay, four little squares, in the drawer.&nbsp; Mr. Rochester had himself written the direction, &ldquo;Mrs. Rochester, --- Hotel, London,&rdquo; on each: I could not persuade myself to affix them, or to have them affixed.&nbsp; Mrs. Rochester!&nbsp; She did not exist: she would not be born till to-morrow, some time after eight o&rsquo;clock a.m.</p></div> </div>
