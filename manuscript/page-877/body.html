<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>As I rose and dressed, I thought over what had happened, and wondered if it were a dream.&nbsp; I could not be certain of the reality till I had seen Mr. Rochester again, and heard him renew his words of love and promise.</p><p>While arranging my hair, I looked at my face in the glass, and felt it was no longer plain: there was hope in its aspect and life in its colour; and my eyes seemed as if they had beheld the fount of fruition, and borrowed beams from the lustrous ripple.&nbsp; I had often been unwilling to look at my master, because I feared he could not be pleased at my look; but I was sure I might lift my face to his now, and not cool his affection by its expression.&nbsp; I took a plain but clean and light summer dress from my drawer and put it on: it seemed no attire had ever so well become me, because none had I ever worn in so blissful a mood.</p></div> </div>
