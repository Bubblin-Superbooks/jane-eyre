<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;No: you are very well; and much improved of late; and Mr. Rochester, I daresay, is fond of you.&nbsp; I have always noticed that you were a sort of pet of his.&nbsp; There are times when, for your sake, I have been a little uneasy at his marked preference, and have wished to put you on your guard: but I did not like to suggest even the possibility of wrong.&nbsp; I knew such an idea would shock, perhaps offend you; and you were so discreet, and so thoroughly modest and sensible, I hoped you might be trusted to protect yourself.&nbsp; Last night I cannot tell you what I suffered when I sought all over the house, and could find you nowhere, nor the master either; and then, at twelve o&rsquo;clock, saw you come in with him.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
