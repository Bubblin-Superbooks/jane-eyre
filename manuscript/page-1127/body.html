<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The girl emptied the stiffened mould into my hand, and I devoured it ravenously.</p><p>As the wet twilight deepened, I stopped in a solitary bridle-path, which I had been pursuing an hour or more.</p><p>&ldquo;My strength is quite failing me,&rdquo; I said in a soliloquy.&nbsp; &ldquo;I feel I cannot go much farther.&nbsp; Shall I be an outcast again this night?&nbsp; While the rain descends so, must I lay my head on the cold, drenched ground?&nbsp; I fear I cannot do otherwise: for who will receive me?&nbsp; But it will be very dreadful, with this feeling of hunger, faintness, chill, and this sense of desolation&mdash;this total prostration of hope.&nbsp; In all likelihood, though, I should die before morning.&nbsp; And why cannot I reconcile myself to the prospect of death?&nbsp; Why do I struggle to retain a valueless life?&nbsp;</p></div> </div>
