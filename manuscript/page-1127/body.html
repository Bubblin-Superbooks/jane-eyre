<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Well, I would rather die yonder than in a street or on a frequented road,&rdquo; I reflected.&nbsp; &ldquo;And far better that crows and ravens&mdash;if any ravens there be in these regions&mdash;should pick my flesh from my bones, than that they should be prisoned in a workhouse coffin and moulder in a pauper&rsquo;s grave.&rdquo;</p><p>To the hill, then, I turned.&nbsp; I reached it.&nbsp; It remained now only to find a hollow where I could lie down, and feel at least hidden, if not secure.&nbsp; But all the surface of the waste looked level.&nbsp; It showed no variation but of tint: green, where rush and moss overgrew the marshes; black, where the dry soil bore only heath.&nbsp; Dark as it was getting, I could still see these changes, though but as mere alternations of light and shade; for colour had faded with the daylight.</p></div> </div>
