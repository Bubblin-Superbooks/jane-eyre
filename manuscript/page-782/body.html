<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; I went, and having found Bessie and despatched her on my errand, I proceeded to take further measures.&nbsp; It had heretofore been my habit always to shrink from arrogance: received as I had been to-day, I should, a year ago, have resolved to quit Gateshead the very next morning; now, it was disclosed to me all at once that that would be a foolish plan.&nbsp; I had taken a journey of a hundred miles to see my aunt, and I must stay with her till she was better&mdash;or dead: as to her daughters&rsquo; pride or folly, I must put it on one side, make myself independent of it.&nbsp; So I addressed the housekeeper; asked her to show me a room, told her I should probably be a visitor here for a week or two, had my trunk conveyed to my chamber, and followed it thither myself: I met Bessie on the landing.</p></div> </div>
