<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; Oh, that fear of his self-abandonment&mdash;far worse than my abandonment&mdash;how it goaded me!&nbsp; It was a barbed arrow-head in my breast; it tore me when I tried to extract it; it sickened me when remembrance thrust it farther in.&nbsp; Birds began singing in brake and copse: birds were faithful to their mates; birds were emblems of love.&nbsp; What was I?&nbsp; In the midst of my pain of heart and frantic effort of principle, I abhorred myself.&nbsp; I had no solace from self-approbation: none even from self-respect.&nbsp; I had injured&mdash;wounded&mdash;left my master.&nbsp; I was hateful in my own eyes.&nbsp; Still I could not turn, nor retrace one step.&nbsp; God must have led me on.&nbsp; As to my own will or conscience, impassioned grief had trampled one and stifled the other.&nbsp; I was weeping wildly as I walked along my solitary way: fast, fast I went like one delirious.</p></div> </div>
