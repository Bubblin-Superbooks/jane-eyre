<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;I must be responsible for the circumstance, sir,&rdquo; replied Miss Temple: &ldquo;the breakfast was so ill prepared that the pupils could not possibly eat it; and I dared not allow them to remain fasting till dinner-time.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Madam, allow me an instant.&nbsp; You are aware that my plan in bringing up these girls is, not to accustom them to habits of luxury and indulgence, but to render them hardy, patient, self-denying.&nbsp; Should any little accidental disappointment of the appetite occur, such as the spoiling of a meal, the under or the over dressing of a dish, the incident ought not to be neutralised by replacing with something more delicate the comfort lost, thus pampering the body and obviating the aim of this institution; it ought to be improved to the spiritual edification of the pupils, by encouraging them to evince fortitude under temporary privation.</p></div> </div>
