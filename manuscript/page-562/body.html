<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re coming, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; was the answer.&nbsp; &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll be here in ten minutes.&rdquo;</p><p>Ad&egrave;le flew to the window.&nbsp; I followed, taking care to stand on one side, so that, screened by the curtain, I could see without being seen.</p><p>The ten minutes John had given seemed very long, but at last wheels were heard; four equestrians galloped up the drive, and after them came two open carriages.&nbsp; Fluttering veils and waving plumes filled the vehicles; two of the cavaliers were young, dashing-looking gentlemen; the third was Mr. Rochester, on his black horse, Mesrour, Pilot bounding before him; at his side rode a lady, and he and she were the first of the party.&nbsp; Her purple riding-habit almost swept the ground, her veil streamed long on the breeze; mingling with its transparent folds, and gleaming through them, shone rich raven ringlets.</p></div> </div>
