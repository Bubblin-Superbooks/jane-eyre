<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The meal over, prayers were read by Miss Miller, and the classes filed off, two and two, upstairs.&nbsp; Overpowered by this time with weariness, I scarcely noticed what sort of a place the bedroom was, except that, like the schoolroom, I saw it was very long.&nbsp; To-night I was to be Miss Miller&rsquo;s bed-fellow; she helped me to undress: when laid down I glanced at the long rows of beds, each of which was quickly filled with two occupants; in ten minutes the single light was extinguished, and amidst silence and complete darkness I fell asleep.</p><p>The night passed rapidly.&nbsp; I was too tired even to dream; I only once awoke to hear the wind rave in furious gusts, and the rain fall in torrents, and to be sensible that Miss Miller had taken her place by my side.</p></div> </div>
