<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Can there be life here?&rdquo; I asked.</p><p>Yes, life of some kind there was; for I heard a movement&mdash;that narrow front-door was unclosing, and some shape was about to issue from the grange.</p><p>It opened slowly: a figure came out into the twilight and stood on the step; a man without a hat: he stretched forth his hand as if to feel whether it rained.&nbsp; Dusk as it was, I had recognised him&mdash;it was my master, Edward Fairfax Rochester, and no other.</p><p>I stayed my step, almost my breath, and stood to watch him&mdash;to examine him, myself unseen, and alas! to him invisible.&nbsp; It was a sudden meeting, and one in which rapture was kept well in check by pain.&nbsp; I had no difficulty in restraining my voice from exclamation, my step from hasty advance.</p></div> </div>
