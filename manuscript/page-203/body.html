<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The Sunday evening was spent in repeating, by heart, the Church Catechism, and the fifth, sixth, and seventh chapters of St. Matthew; and in listening to a long sermon, read by Miss Miller, whose irrepressible yawns attested her weariness.&nbsp; A frequent interlude of these performances was the enactment of the part of Eutychus by some half-dozen of little girls, who, overpowered with sleep, would fall down, if not out of the third loft, yet off the fourth form, and be taken up half dead.&nbsp; The remedy was, to thrust them forward into the centre of the schoolroom, and oblige them to stand there till the sermon was finished.&nbsp; Sometimes their feet failed them, and they sank together in a heap; they were then propped up with the monitors&rsquo; high stools.</p></div> </div>
