<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>I avail myself of the opportunity which a third edition of &ldquo;Jane Eyre&rdquo; affords me, of again addressing a word to the Public, to explain that my claim to the title of novelist rests on this one work alone.&nbsp; If, therefore, the authorship of other works of fiction has been attributed to me, an honour is awarded where it is not merited; and consequently, denied where it is justly due.</p><p>This explanation will serve to rectify mistakes which may already have been made, and to prevent future errors.</p><p>CURRER BELL.</p><p>April 13th, 1848.</p></div> </div>
