<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Miss Jane, take off your pinafore; what are you doing there?&nbsp; Have you washed your hands and face this morning?&rdquo;&nbsp; I gave another tug before I answered, for I wanted the bird to be secure of its bread: the sash yielded; I scattered the crumbs, some on the stone sill, some on the cherry-tree bough, then, closing the window, I replied&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;No, Bessie; I have only just finished dusting.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Troublesome, careless child! and what are you doing now?&nbsp; You look quite red, as if you had been about some mischief: what were you opening the window for?&rdquo;</p><p>I was spared the trouble of answering, for Bessie seemed in too great a hurry to listen to explanations; she hauled me to the washstand, inflicted a merciless, but happily brief scrub on my face and hands with soap, water, and a coarse towel;</p></div> </div>
