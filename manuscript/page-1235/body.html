<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;My cottage is clean and weather-proof; my furniture sufficient and commodious.&nbsp; All I see has made me thankful, not despondent.&nbsp; I am not absolutely such a fool and sensualist as to regret the absence of a carpet, a sofa, and silver plate; besides, five weeks ago I had nothing&mdash;I was an outcast, a beggar, a vagrant; now I have acquaintance, a home, a business.&nbsp; I wonder at the goodness of God; the generosity of my friends; the bounty of my lot.&nbsp; I do not repine.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But you feel solitude an oppression?&nbsp; The little house there behind you is dark and empty.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I have hardly had time yet to enjoy a sense of tranquillity, much less to grow impatient under one of loneliness.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
