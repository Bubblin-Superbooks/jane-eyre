<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>No severe or prolonged bodily illness followed this incident of the red-room; it only gave my nerves a shock of which I feel the reverberation to this day.&nbsp; Yes, Mrs. Reed, to you I owe some fearful pangs of mental suffering, but I ought to forgive you, for you knew not what you did: while rending my heart-strings, you thought you were only uprooting my bad propensities.</p><p>Next day, by noon, I was up and dressed, and sat wrapped in a shawl by the nursery hearth.&nbsp; I felt physically weak and broken down: but my worse ailment was an unutterable wretchedness of mind: a wretchedness which kept drawing from me silent tears; no sooner had I wiped one salt drop from my cheek than another followed.&nbsp; Yet, I thought, I ought to have been happy, for none of the Reeds were there, they were all gone out in the carriage with their mama.</p></div> </div>
