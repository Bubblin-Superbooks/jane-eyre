<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>I continued the labours of the village-school as actively and faithfully as I could.&nbsp; It was truly hard work at first.&nbsp; Some time elapsed before, with all my efforts, I could comprehend my scholars and their nature.&nbsp; Wholly untaught, with faculties quite torpid, they seemed to me hopelessly dull; and, at first sight, all dull alike: but I soon found I was mistaken.&nbsp; There was a difference amongst them as amongst the educated; and when I got to know them, and they me, this difference rapidly developed itself.&nbsp; Their amazement at me, my language, my rules, and ways, once subsided, I found some of these heavy-looking, gaping rustics wake up into sharp-witted girls enough.&nbsp; Many showed themselves obliging, and amiable too; and I discovered amongst them not a few examples of natural politeness, and innate self-respect, as well as of excellent capacity, that won both my goodwill and my admiration.</p></div> </div>
