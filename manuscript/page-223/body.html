<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>There was I, then, mounted aloft; I, who had said I could not bear the shame of standing on my natural feet in the middle of the room, was now exposed to general view on a pedestal of infamy.&nbsp; What my sensations were no language can describe; but just as they all rose, stifling my breath and constricting my throat, a girl came up and passed me: in passing, she lifted her eyes.&nbsp; What a strange light inspired them!&nbsp; What an extraordinary sensation that ray sent through me!&nbsp; How the new feeling bore me up!&nbsp; It was as if a martyr, a hero, had passed a slave or victim, and imparted strength in the transit.&nbsp; I mastered the rising hysteria, lifted up my head, and took a firm stand on the stool.&nbsp; Helen Burns asked some slight question about her work of Miss Smith, was chidden for the triviality of the inquiry, returned to her place, and smiled at me as she again went by.</p></div> </div>
