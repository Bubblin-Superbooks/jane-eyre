<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Cruel, cruel deserter!&nbsp; Oh, Jane, what did I feel when I discovered you had fled from Thornfield, and when I could nowhere find you; and, after examining your apartment, ascertained that you had taken no money, nor anything which could serve as an equivalent!&nbsp; A pearl necklace I had given you lay untouched in its little casket; your trunks were left corded and locked as they had been prepared for the bridal tour.&nbsp; What could my darling do, I asked, left destitute and penniless?&nbsp; And what did she do?&nbsp; Let me hear now.&rdquo;</p><p>Thus urged, I began the narrative of my experience for the last year.&nbsp; I softened considerably what related to the three days of wandering and starvation, because to have told him all would have been to inflict unnecessary pain: the little I did say lacerated his faithful heart deeper than I wished.</p></div> </div>
