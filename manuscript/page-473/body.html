<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;It has struck nine, sir.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Never mind,&mdash;wait a minute: Ad&egrave;le is not ready to go to bed yet.&nbsp; My position, Miss Eyre, with my back to the fire, and my face to the room, favours observation.&nbsp; While talking to you, I have also occasionally watched Ad&egrave;le (I have my own reasons for thinking her a curious study,&mdash;reasons that I may, nay, that I shall, impart to you some day).&nbsp; She pulled out of her box, about ten minutes ago, a little pink silk frock; rapture lit her face as she unfolded it; coquetry runs in her blood, blends with her brains, and seasons the marrow of her bones.&nbsp; &lsquo;Il faut que je l&rsquo;essaie!&rsquo; cried she, &lsquo;et &agrave; l&rsquo;instant m&ecirc;me!&rsquo; and she rushed out of the room.</p></div> </div>
