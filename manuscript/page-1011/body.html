<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Jane Eyre, who had been an ardent, expectant woman&mdash;almost a bride, was a cold, solitary girl again: her life was pale; her prospects were desolate.&nbsp; A Christmas frost had come at midsummer; a white December storm had whirled over June; ice glazed the ripe apples, drifts crushed the blowing roses; on hayfield and cornfield lay a frozen shroud: lanes which last night blushed full of flowers, to-day were pathless with untrodden snow; and the woods, which twelve hours since waved leafy and flagrant as groves between the tropics, now spread, waste, wild, and white as pine-forests in wintry Norway.&nbsp; My hopes were all dead&mdash;struck with a subtle doom, such as, in one night, fell on all the first-born in the land of Egypt.&nbsp; I looked on my cherished wishes, yesterday so blooming and glowing; they lay stark, chill, livid corpses that could never revive.</p></div> </div>
