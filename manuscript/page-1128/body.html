<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>My eye still roved over the sullen swell and along the moor-edge, vanishing amidst the wildest scenery, when at one dim point, far in among the marshes and the ridges, a light sprang up.&nbsp; &ldquo;That is an ignis fatuus,&rdquo; was my first thought; and I expected it would soon vanish.&nbsp; It burnt on, however, quite steadily, neither receding nor advancing.&nbsp; &ldquo;Is it, then, a bonfire just kindled?&rdquo; I questioned.&nbsp; I watched to see whether it would spread: but no; as it did not diminish, so it did not enlarge.&nbsp; &ldquo;It may be a candle in a house,&rdquo; I then conjectured; &ldquo;but if so, I can never reach it.&nbsp; It is much too far away: and were it within a yard of me, what would it avail?&nbsp; I should but knock at the door to have it shut in my face.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
