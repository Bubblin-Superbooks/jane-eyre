<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Mr. St. John&mdash;sitting as still as one of the dusty pictures on the walls, keeping his eyes fixed on the page he perused, and his lips mutely sealed&mdash;was easy enough to examine.&nbsp; Had he been a statue instead of a man, he could not have been easier.&nbsp; He was young&mdash;perhaps from twenty-eight to thirty&mdash;tall, slender; his face riveted the eye; it was like a Greek face, very pure in outline: quite a straight, classic nose; quite an Athenian mouth and chin.&nbsp; It is seldom, indeed, an English face comes so near the antique models as did his.&nbsp; He might well be a little shocked at the irregularity of my lineaments, his own being so harmonious.&nbsp; His eyes were large and blue, with brown lashes; his high forehead, colourless as ivory, was partially streaked over by careless locks of fair hair.</p></div> </div>
