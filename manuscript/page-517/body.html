<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>I both wished and feared to see Mr. Rochester on the day which followed this sleepless night: I wanted to hear his voice again, yet feared to meet his eye.&nbsp; During the early part of the morning, I momentarily expected his coming; he was not in the frequent habit of entering the schoolroom, but he did step in for a few minutes sometimes, and I had the impression that he was sure to visit it that day.</p><p>But the morning passed just as usual: nothing happened to interrupt the quiet course of Ad&egrave;le&rsquo;s studies; only soon after breakfast, I heard some bustle in the neighbourhood of Mr. Rochester&rsquo;s chamber, Mrs. Fairfax&rsquo;s voice, and Leah&rsquo;s, and the cook&rsquo;s&mdash;that is, John&rsquo;s wife&mdash;and even John&rsquo;s own gruff tones.</p></div> </div>
