<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>It was not without a certain wild pleasure I ran before the wind, delivering my trouble of mind to the measureless air-torrent thundering through space.&nbsp; Descending the laurel walk, I faced the wreck of the chestnut-tree; it stood up black and riven: the trunk, split down the centre, gasped ghastly.&nbsp; The cloven halves were not broken from each other, for the firm base and strong roots kept them unsundered below; though community of vitality was destroyed&mdash;the sap could flow no more: their great boughs on each side were dead, and next winter&rsquo;s tempests would be sure to fell one or both to earth: as yet, however, they might be said to form one tree&mdash;a ruin, but an entire ruin.</p></div> </div>
