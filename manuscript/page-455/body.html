<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Do as you please, sir.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That is no answer; or rather it is a very irritating, because a very evasive one.&nbsp; Reply clearly.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think, sir, you have a right to command me, merely because you are older than I, or because you have seen more of the world than I have; your claim to superiority depends on the use you have made of your time and experience.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Humph!&nbsp; Promptly spoken.&nbsp; But I won&rsquo;t allow that, seeing that it would never suit my case, as I have made an indifferent, not to say a bad, use of both advantages.&nbsp; Leaving superiority out of the question, then, you must still agree to receive my orders now and then, without being piqued or hurt by the tone of command.&nbsp; Will you?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
