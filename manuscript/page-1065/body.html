<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Yet I could not live alone; so I tried the companionship of mistresses.&nbsp; The first I chose was C&eacute;line Varens&mdash;another of those steps which make a man spurn himself when he recalls them.&nbsp; You already know what she was, and how my liaison with her terminated.&nbsp; She had two successors: an Italian, Giacinta, and a German, Clara; both considered singularly handsome.&nbsp; What was their beauty to me in a few weeks?&nbsp; Giacinta was unprincipled and violent: I tired of her in three months.&nbsp; Clara was honest and quiet; but heavy, mindless, and unimpressible: not one whit to my taste.&nbsp; I was glad to give her a sufficient sum to set her up in a good line of business, and so get decently rid of her.&nbsp; But, Jane, I see by your face you are not forming a very favourable opinion of me just now.&nbsp; You think me an unfeeling, loose-principled rake: don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
