<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;A new servitude!&nbsp; There is something in that,&rdquo; I soliloquised (mentally, be it understood; I did not talk aloud), &ldquo;I know there is, because it does not sound too sweet; it is not like such words as Liberty, Excitement, Enjoyment: delightful sounds truly; but no more than sounds for me; and so hollow and fleeting that it is mere waste of time to listen to them.&nbsp; But Servitude!&nbsp; That must be matter of fact.&nbsp; Any one may serve: I have served here eight years; now all I want is to serve elsewhere.&nbsp; Can I not get so much of my own will?&nbsp; Is not the thing feasible?&nbsp; Yes&mdash;yes&mdash;the end is not so difficult; if I had only a brain active enough to ferret out the means of attaining it.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
