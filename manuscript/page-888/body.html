<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; After a brief stay there, I shall bear my treasure to regions nearer the sun: to French vineyards and Italian plains; and she shall see whatever is famous in old story and in modern record: she shall taste, too, of the life of cities; and she shall learn to value herself by just comparison with others.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Shall I travel?&mdash;and with you, sir?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You shall sojourn at Paris, Rome, and Naples: at Florence, Venice, and Vienna: all the ground I have wandered over shall be re-trodden by you: wherever I stamped my hoof, your sylph&rsquo;s foot shall step also.&nbsp; Ten years since, I flew through Europe half mad; with disgust, hate, and rage as my companions: now I shall revisit it healed and cleansed, with a very angel as my comforter.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
