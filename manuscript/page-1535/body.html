<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>ere I retired to my dreary rest, I supplicated God, that, if it seemed good to Him, I might soon be taken from this life, and admitted to that world to come, where there was still hope of rejoining Jane.</p><p>&ldquo;I was in my own room, and sitting by the window, which was open: it soothed me to feel the balmy night-air; though I could see no stars and only by a vague, luminous haze, knew the presence of a moon.&nbsp; I longed for thee, Janet!&nbsp; Oh, I longed for thee both with soul and flesh!&nbsp; I asked of God, at once in anguish and humility, if I had not been long enough desolate, afflicted, tormented; and might not soon taste bliss and peace once more.&nbsp; That I merited all I endured, I acknowledged&mdash;that I could scarcely endure more, I pleaded; and the alpha and omega of my heart&rsquo;s wishes broke involuntarily from my lips in the words&mdash;&lsquo;Jane!&nbsp; Jane!&nbsp; Jane!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
