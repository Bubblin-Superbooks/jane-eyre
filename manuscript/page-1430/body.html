<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Thank you, Jane.&nbsp; As I said, I shall return from Cambridge in a fortnight: that space, then, is yet left you for reflection.&nbsp; If I listened to human pride, I should say no more to you of marriage with me; but I listen to my duty, and keep steadily in view my first aim&mdash;to do all things to the glory of God.&nbsp; My Master was long-suffering: so will I be.&nbsp; I cannot give you up to perdition as a vessel of wrath: repent&mdash;resolve, while there is yet time.&nbsp; Remember, we are bid to work while it is day&mdash;warned that &lsquo;the night cometh when no man shall work.&rsquo;&nbsp; Remember the fate of Dives, who had his good things in this life.&nbsp; God give you strength to choose that better part which shall not be taken from you!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
