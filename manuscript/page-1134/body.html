<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; I could see clearly a room with a sanded floor, clean scoured; a dresser of walnut, with pewter plates ranged in rows, reflecting the redness and radiance of a glowing peat-fire.&nbsp; I could see a clock, a white deal table, some chairs.&nbsp; The candle, whose ray had been my beacon, burnt on the table; and by its light an elderly woman, somewhat rough-looking, but scrupulously clean, like all about her, was knitting a stocking.</p><p>I noticed these objects cursorily only&mdash;in them there was nothing extraordinary.&nbsp; A group of more interest appeared near the hearth, sitting still amidst the rosy peace and warmth suffusing it.&nbsp; Two young, graceful women&mdash;ladies in every point&mdash;sat, one in a low rocking-chair, the other on a lower stool;</p></div> </div>
