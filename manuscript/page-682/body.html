<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Where was I?&nbsp; Did I wake or sleep?&nbsp; Had I been dreaming?&nbsp; Did I dream still?&nbsp; The old woman&rsquo;s voice had changed: her accent, her gesture, and all were familiar to me as my own face in a glass&mdash;as the speech of my own tongue.&nbsp; I got up, but did not go.&nbsp; I looked; I stirred the fire, and I looked again: but she drew her bonnet and her bandage closer about her face, and again beckoned me to depart.&nbsp; The flame illuminated her hand stretched out: roused now, and on the alert for discoveries, I at once noticed that hand.&nbsp; It was no more the withered limb of eld than my own; it was a rounded supple member, with smooth fingers, symmetrically turned; a broad ring flashed on the little finger, and stooping forward, I looked at it, and saw a gem I had seen a hundred times before.</p></div> </div>
