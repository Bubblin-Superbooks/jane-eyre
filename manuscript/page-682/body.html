<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; I have an inward treasure born with me, which can keep me alive if all extraneous delights should be withheld, or offered only at a price I cannot afford to give.&rsquo;&nbsp; The forehead declares, &lsquo;Reason sits firm and holds the reins, and she will not let the feelings burst away and hurry her to wild chasms.&nbsp; The passions may rage furiously, like true heathens, as they are; and the desires may imagine all sorts of vain things: but judgment shall still have the last word in every argument, and the casting vote in every decision.&nbsp; Strong wind, earthquake-shock, and fire may pass by: but I shall follow the guiding of that still small voice which interprets the dictates of conscience.&rsquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well said, forehead; your declaration shall be respected.</p></div> </div>
