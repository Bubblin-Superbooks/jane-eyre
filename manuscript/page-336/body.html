<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; Everything appeared very stately and imposing to me; but then I was so little accustomed to grandeur.&nbsp; The hall-door, which was half of glass, stood open; I stepped over the threshold.&nbsp; It was a fine autumn morning; the early sun shone serenely on embrowned groves and still green fields; advancing on to the lawn, I looked up and surveyed the front of the mansion.&nbsp; It was three storeys high, of proportions not vast, though considerable: a gentleman&rsquo;s manor-house, not a nobleman&rsquo;s seat: battlements round the top gave it a picturesque look.&nbsp; Its grey front stood out well from the background of a rookery, whose cawing tenants were now on the wing: they flew over the lawn and grounds to alight in a great meadow, from which these were separated by a sunk fence, and where an array of mighty old thorn trees, strong, knotty, and broad as oaks, at once explained the etymology of the mansion&rsquo;s designation.</p></div> </div>
