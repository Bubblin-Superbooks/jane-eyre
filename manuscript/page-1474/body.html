<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; Even when within a very short distance of the manor-house, you could see nothing of it, so thick and dark grew the timber of the gloomy wood about it.&nbsp; Iron gates between granite pillars showed me where to enter, and passing through them, I found myself at once in the twilight of close-ranked trees.&nbsp; There was a grass-grown track descending the forest aisle between hoar and knotty shafts and under branched arches.&nbsp; I followed it, expecting soon to reach the dwelling; but it stretched on and on, it wound far and farther: no sign of habitation or grounds was visible.</p><p>I thought I had taken a wrong direction and lost my way.&nbsp; The darkness of natural as well as of sylvan dusk gathered over me.&nbsp; I looked round in search of another road.&nbsp; There was none: all was interwoven stem, columnar trunk, dense summer foliage&mdash;no opening anywhere.</p></div> </div>
