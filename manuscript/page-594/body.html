<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; Did I say, a few days since, that I had nothing to do with him but to receive my salary at his hands?&nbsp; Did I forbid myself to think of him in any other light than as a paymaster?&nbsp; Blasphemy against nature!&nbsp; Every good, true, vigorous feeling I have gathers impulsively round him.&nbsp; I know I must conceal my sentiments: I must smother hope; I must remember that he cannot care much for me.&nbsp; For when I say that I am of his kind, I do not mean that I have his force to influence, and his spell to attract; I mean only that I have certain tastes and feelings in common with him.&nbsp; I must, then, repeat continually that we are for ever sundered:&mdash;and yet, while I breathe and think, I must love him.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
