<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Twenty years ago, a poor curate&mdash;never mind his name at this moment&mdash;fell in love with a rich man&rsquo;s daughter; she fell in love with him, and married him, against the advice of all her friends, who consequently disowned her immediately after the wedding.&nbsp; Before two years passed, the rash pair were both dead, and laid quietly side by side under one slab.&nbsp; (I have seen their grave; it formed part of the pavement of a huge churchyard surrounding the grim, soot-black old cathedral of an overgrown manufacturing town in ---shire.)&nbsp; They left a daughter, which, at its very birth, Charity received in her lap&mdash;cold as that of the snow-drift I almost stuck fast in to-night.&nbsp; Charity carried the friendless thing to the house of its rich maternal relations; it was reared by an aunt-in-law, called (I come to names now) Mrs. Reed of Gateshead.</p></div> </div>
