<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; I will even tell you the name of the establishment, where I passed six years as a pupil, and two as a teacher&mdash;Lowood Orphan Asylum, ---shire: you will have heard of it, Mr. Rivers?&mdash;the Rev. Robert Brocklehurst is the treasurer.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I have heard of Mr. Brocklehurst, and I have seen the school.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I left Lowood nearly a year since to become a private governess.&nbsp; I obtained a good situation, and was happy.&nbsp; This place I was obliged to leave four days before I came here.&nbsp; The reason of my departure I cannot and ought not to explain: it would be useless, dangerous, and would sound incredible.&nbsp; No blame attached to me: I am as free from culpability as any one of you three.&nbsp; Miserable I am, and must be for a time; for the catastrophe which drove me from a house I had found a paradise was of a strange and direful nature.</p></div> </div>
