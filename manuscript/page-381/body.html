<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>It was very near, but not yet in sight; when, in addition to the tramp, tramp, I heard a rush under the hedge, and close down by the hazel stems glided a great dog, whose black and white colour made him a distinct object against the trees.&nbsp; It was exactly one form of Bessie&rsquo;s Gytrash&mdash;a lion-like creature with long hair and a huge head: it passed me, however, quietly enough; not staying to look up, with strange pretercanine eyes, in my face, as I half expected it would.&nbsp; The horse followed,&mdash;a tall steed, and on its back a rider.&nbsp; The man, the human being, broke the spell at once.&nbsp; Nothing ever rode the Gytrash: it was always alone; and goblins, to my notions, though they might tenant the dumb carcasses of beasts, could scarce covet shelter in the commonplace human form.&nbsp; No Gytrash was this,&mdash;only a traveller taking the short cut to Millcote.</p></div> </div>
