<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> mentally, I still possessed my soul, and with it the certainty of ultimate safety.&nbsp; The soul, fortunately, has an interpreter&mdash;often an unconscious, but still a truthful interpreter&mdash;in the eye.&nbsp; My eye rose to his; and while I looked in his fierce face I gave an involuntary sigh; his gripe was painful, and my over-taxed strength almost exhausted.</p><p>&ldquo;Never,&rdquo; said he, as he ground his teeth, &ldquo;never was anything at once so frail and so indomitable.&nbsp; A mere reed she feels in my hand!&rdquo;&nbsp; (And he shook me with the force of his hold.)&nbsp; &ldquo;I could bend her with my finger and thumb: and what good would it do if I bent, if I uptore, if I crushed her?&nbsp; Consider that eye: consider the resolute, wild, free thing looking out of it, defying me, with more than courage&mdash;with a stern triumph.</p></div> </div>
