<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;I am not your dear; I cannot lie down: send me to school soon, Mrs. Reed, for I hate to live here.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I will indeed send her to school soon,&rdquo; murmured Mrs. Reed sotto voce; and gathering up her work, she abruptly quitted the apartment.</p><p>I was left there alone&mdash;winner of the field.&nbsp; It was the hardest battle I had fought, and the first victory I had gained: I stood awhile on the rug, where Mr. Brocklehurst had stood, and I enjoyed my conqueror&rsquo;s solitude.&nbsp; First, I smiled to myself and felt elate; but this fierce pleasure subsided in me as fast as did the accelerated throb of my pulses.&nbsp; A child cannot quarrel with its elders, as I had done; cannot give its furious feelings uncontrolled play, as I had given mine, without experiencing afterwards the pang of remorse and the chill of reaction.</p></div> </div>
