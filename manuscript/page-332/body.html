<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>When Mrs. Fairfax had bidden me a kind good-night, and I had fastened my door, gazed leisurely round, and in some measure effaced the eerie impression made by that wide hall, that dark and spacious staircase, and that long, cold gallery, by the livelier aspect of my little room, I remembered that, after a day of bodily fatigue and mental anxiety, I was now at last in safe haven.&nbsp; The impulse of gratitude swelled my heart, and I knelt down at the bedside, and offered up thanks where thanks were due; not forgetting, ere I rose, to implore aid on my further path, and the power of meriting the kindness which seemed so frankly offered me before it was earned.&nbsp; My couch had no thorns in it that night; my solitary room no fears.&nbsp; At once weary and content, I slept soon and soundly: when I awoke it was broad day.</p></div> </div>
