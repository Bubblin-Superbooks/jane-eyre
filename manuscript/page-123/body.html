<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; A ridge of lighted heath, alive, glancing, devouring, would have been a meet emblem of my mind when I accused and menaced Mrs. Reed: the same ridge, black and blasted after the flames are dead, would have represented as meetly my subsequent condition, when half-an-hour&rsquo;s silence and reflection had shown me the madness of my conduct, and the dreariness of my hated and hating position.</p><p>Something of vengeance I had tasted for the first time; as aromatic wine it seemed, on swallowing, warm and racy: its after-flavour, metallic and corroding, gave me a sensation as if I had been poisoned.&nbsp; Willingly would I now have gone and asked Mrs. Reed&rsquo;s pardon; but I knew, partly from experience and partly from instinct, that was the way to make her repulse me with double scorn, thereby re-exciting every turbulent impulse of my nature.</p></div> </div>
