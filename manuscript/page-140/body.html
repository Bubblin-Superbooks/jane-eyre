<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Is there a little girl called Jane Eyre here?&rdquo; she asked.&nbsp; I answered &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; and was then lifted out; my trunk was handed down, and the coach instantly drove away.</p><p>I was stiff with long sitting, and bewildered with the noise and motion of the coach: Gathering my faculties, I looked about me.&nbsp; Rain, wind, and darkness filled the air; nevertheless, I dimly discerned a wall before me and a door open in it; through this door I passed with my new guide: she shut and locked it behind her.&nbsp; There was now visible a house or houses&mdash;for the building spread far&mdash;with many windows, and lights burning in some; we went up a broad pebbly path, splashing wet, and were admitted at a door; then the servant led me through a passage into a room with a fire, where she left me alone.</p></div> </div>
