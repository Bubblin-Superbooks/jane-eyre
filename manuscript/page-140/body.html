<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>I remember but little of the journey; I only know that the day seemed to me of a preternatural length, and that we appeared to travel over hundreds of miles of road.&nbsp; We passed through several towns, and in one, a very large one, the coach stopped; the horses were taken out, and the passengers alighted to dine.&nbsp; I was carried into an inn, where the guard wanted me to have some dinner; but, as I had no appetite, he left me in an immense room with a fireplace at each end, a chandelier pendent from the ceiling, and a little red gallery high up against the wall filled with musical instruments.&nbsp; Here I walked about for a long time, feeling very strange, and mortally apprehensive of some one coming in and kidnapping me; for I believed in kidnappers, their exploits having frequently figured in Bessie&rsquo;s fireside chronicles.</p></div> </div>
