<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Mr. Rochester continued, hardily and recklessly: &ldquo;Bigamy is an ugly word!&mdash;I meant, however, to be a bigamist; but fate has out-manoeuvred me, or Providence has checked me,&mdash;perhaps the last.&nbsp; I am little better than a devil at this moment; and, as my pastor there would tell me, deserve no doubt the sternest judgments of God, even to the quenchless fire and deathless worm.&nbsp; Gentlemen, my plan is broken up:&mdash;what this lawyer and his client say is true: I have been married, and the woman to whom I was married lives!&nbsp; You say you never heard of a Mrs. Rochester at the house up yonder, Wood; but I daresay you have many a time inclined your ear to gossip about the mysterious lunatic kept there under watch and ward.&nbsp; Some have whispered to you that she is my bastard half-sister: some, my cast-off mistress.</p></div> </div>
