<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>I wrote again: there was a chance of my first letter having missed.&nbsp; Renewed hope followed renewed effort: it shone like the former for some weeks, then, like it, it faded, flickered: not a line, not a word reached me.&nbsp; When half a year wasted in vain expectancy, my hope died out, and then I felt dark indeed.</p><p>A fine spring shone round me, which I could not enjoy.&nbsp; Summer approached; Diana tried to cheer me: she said I looked ill, and wished to accompany me to the sea-side.&nbsp; This St. John opposed; he said I did not want dissipation, I wanted employment; my present life was too purposeless, I required an aim; and, I suppose, by way of supplying deficiencies, he prolonged still further my lessons in Hindostanee, and grew more urgent in requiring their accomplishment: and I, like a fool, never thought of resisting him&mdash;I could not resist him.</p></div> </div>
