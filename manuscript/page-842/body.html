<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> To so practised and indefatigable a horseman as Mr. Rochester, it would be but a morning&rsquo;s ride.&nbsp; I began to cherish hopes I had no right to conceive: that the match was broken off; that rumour had been mistaken; that one or both parties had changed their minds.&nbsp; I used to look at my master&rsquo;s face to see if it were sad or fierce; but I could not remember the time when it had been so uniformly clear of clouds or evil feelings.&nbsp; If, in the moments I and my pupil spent with him, I lacked spirits and sank into inevitable dejection, he became even gay.&nbsp; Never had he called me more frequently to his presence; never been kinder to me when there&mdash;and, alas! never had I loved him so well.</p></div> </div>
