<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; I am poor; for I find that, when I have paid my father&rsquo;s debts, all the patrimony remaining to me will be this crumbling grange, the row of scathed firs behind, and the patch of moorish soil, with the yew-trees and holly-bushes in front.&nbsp; I am obscure: Rivers is an old name; but of the three sole descendants of the race, two earn the dependant&rsquo;s crust among strangers, and the third considers himself an alien from his native country&mdash;not only for life, but in death.&nbsp; Yes, and deems, and is bound to deem, himself honoured by the lot, and aspires but after the day when the cross of separation from fleshly ties shall be laid on his shoulders, and when the Head of that church-militant of whose humblest members he is one, shall give the word, &lsquo;Rise, follow Me!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
