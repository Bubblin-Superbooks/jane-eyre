<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>with which your eyes are now almost overflowing&mdash;with which your heart is heaving&mdash;with which your hand is trembling in mine.&nbsp; Your pity, my darling, is the suffering mother of love: its anguish is the very natal pang of the divine passion.&nbsp; I accept it, Jane; let the daughter have free advent&mdash;my arms wait to receive her.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Now, sir, proceed; what did you do when you found she was mad?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Jane, I approached the verge of despair; a remnant of self-respect was all that intervened between me and the gulf.&nbsp; In the eyes of the world, I was doubtless covered with grimy dishonour; but I resolved to be clean in my own sight&mdash;and to the last I repudiated the contamination of her crimes, and wrenched myself from connection with her mental defects.</p></div> </div>
