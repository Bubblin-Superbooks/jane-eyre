<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; I lived with that woman upstairs four years, and before that time she had tried me indeed: her character ripened and developed with frightful rapidity; her vices sprang up fast and rank: they were so strong, only cruelty could check them, and I would not use cruelty.&nbsp; What a pigmy intellect she had, and what giant propensities!&nbsp; How fearful were the curses those propensities entailed on me!&nbsp; Bertha Mason, the true daughter of an infamous mother, dragged me through all the hideous and degrading agonies which must attend a man bound to a wife at once intemperate and unchaste.</p><p>&ldquo;My brother in the interval was dead, and at the end of the four years my father died too.&nbsp; I was rich enough now&mdash;yet poor to hideous indigence: a nature the most gross, impure, depraved I ever saw, was associated with mine, and called by the law and by society a part of me.</p></div> </div>
