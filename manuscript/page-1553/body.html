<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>St. John is unmarried: he never will marry now.&nbsp; Himself has hitherto sufficed to the toil, and the toil draws near its close: his glorious sun hastens to its setting.&nbsp; The last letter I received from him drew from my eyes human tears, and yet filled my heart with divine joy: he anticipated his sure reward, his incorruptible crown.&nbsp; I know that a stranger&rsquo;s hand will write to me next, to say that the good and faithful servant has been called at length into the joy of his Lord.&nbsp; And why weep for this?&nbsp; No fear of death will darken St. John&rsquo;s last hour: his mind will be unclouded, his heart will be undaunted, his hope will be sure, his faith steadfast.&nbsp; His own words are a pledge of this&mdash;</p></div> </div>
