<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The roads were heavy, the night misty; my conductor let his horse walk all the way, and the hour and a half extended, I verily believe, to two hours; at last he turned in his seat and said&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re noan so far fro&rsquo; Thornfield now.&rdquo;</p><p>Again I looked out: we were passing a church; I saw its low broad tower against the sky, and its bell was tolling a quarter; I saw a narrow galaxy of lights too, on a hillside, marking a village or hamlet.&nbsp; About ten minutes after, the driver got down and opened a pair of gates: we passed through, and they clashed to behind us.&nbsp; We now slowly ascended a drive, and came upon the long front of a house: candlelight gleamed from one curtained bow-window; all the rest were dark.&nbsp; The car stopped at the front door; it was opened by a maid-servant; I alighted and went in.</p></div> </div>
