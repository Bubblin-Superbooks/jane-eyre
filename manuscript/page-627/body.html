<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I could not unlove him now, merely because I found that he had ceased to notice me&mdash;because I might pass hours in his presence, and he would never once turn his eyes in my direction&mdash;because I saw all his attentions appropriated by a great lady, who scorned to touch me with the hem of her robes as she passed; who, if ever her dark and imperious eye fell on me by chance, would withdraw it instantly as from an object too mean to merit observation.&nbsp; I could not unlove him, because I felt sure he would soon marry this very lady&mdash;because I read daily in her a proud security in his intentions respecting her&mdash;because I witnessed hourly in him a style of courtship which, if careless and choosing rather to be sought than to seek, was yet, in its very carelessness, captivating, and in its very pride, irresistible.</p></div> </div>
