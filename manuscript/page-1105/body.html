<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; I saw ripe bilberries gleaming here and there, like jet beads in the heath: I gathered a handful and ate them with the bread.&nbsp; My hunger, sharp before, was, if not satisfied, appeased by this hermit&rsquo;s meal.&nbsp; I said my evening prayers at its conclusion, and then chose my couch.</p><p>Beside the crag the heath was very deep: when I lay down my feet were buried in it; rising high on each side, it left only a narrow space for the night-air to invade.&nbsp; I folded my shawl double, and spread it over me for a coverlet; a low, mossy swell was my pillow.&nbsp; Thus lodged, I was not, at least&mdash;at the commencement of the night, cold.</p></div> </div>
