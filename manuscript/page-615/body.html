<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Merry days were these at Thornfield Hall; and busy days too: how different from the first three months of stillness, monotony, and solitude I had passed beneath its roof!&nbsp; All sad feelings seemed now driven from the house, all gloomy associations forgotten: there was life everywhere, movement all day long.&nbsp; You could not now traverse the gallery, once so hushed, nor enter the front chambers, once so tenantless, without encountering a smart lady&rsquo;s-maid or a dandy valet.</p><p>The kitchen, the butler&rsquo;s pantry, the servants&rsquo; hall, the entrance hall, were equally alive; and the saloons were only left void and still when the blue sky and halcyon sunshine of the genial spring weather called their occupants out into the grounds.&nbsp; Even when that weather was broken, and continuous rain set in for some days, no damp seemed cast over enjoyment: indoor amusements only became more lively and varied, in consequence of the stop put to outdoor gaiety.</p></div> </div>
