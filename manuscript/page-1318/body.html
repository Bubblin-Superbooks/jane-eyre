<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>I walked fast through the room: I stopped, half suffocated with the thoughts that rose faster than I could receive, comprehend, settle them:&mdash;thoughts of what might, could, would, and should be, and that ere long.&nbsp; I looked at the blank wall: it seemed a sky thick with ascending stars,&mdash;every one lit me to a purpose or delight.&nbsp; Those who had saved my life, whom, till this hour, I had loved barrenly, I could now benefit.&nbsp; They were under a yoke,&mdash;I could free them: they were scattered,&mdash;I could reunite them: the independence, the affluence which was mine, might be theirs too.&nbsp; Were we not four?&nbsp; Twenty thousand pounds shared equally would be five thousand each, justice&mdash;enough and to spare: justice would be done,&mdash;mutual happiness secured.</p></div> </div>
