<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Strange words of a strange love!&nbsp; An austere patriot&rsquo;s passion for his fatherland!&nbsp; He sat down; for half-an-hour we never spoke; neither he to me nor I to him: that interval past, he recommenced&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Jane, I go in six weeks; I have taken my berth in an East Indiaman which sails on the 20th of June.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;God will protect you; for you have undertaken His work,&rdquo; I answered.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;there is my glory and joy.&nbsp; I am the servant of an infallible Master.&nbsp; I am not going out under human guidance, subject to the defective laws and erring control of my feeble fellow-worms: my king, my lawgiver, my captain, is the All-perfect.&nbsp; It seems strange to me that all round me do not burn to enlist under the same banner,&mdash;to join in the same enterprise.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
