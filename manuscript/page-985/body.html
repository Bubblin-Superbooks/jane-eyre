<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Jane, are you ready?&rdquo;</p><p>I rose.&nbsp; There were no groomsmen, no bridesmaids, no relatives to wait for or marshal: none but Mr. Rochester and I.&nbsp; Mrs. Fairfax stood in the hall as we passed.&nbsp;&nbsp; I would fain have spoken to her, but my hand was held by a grasp of iron: I was hurried along by a stride I could hardly follow; and to look at Mr. Rochester&rsquo;s face was to feel that not a second of delay would be tolerated for any purpose.&nbsp; I wonder what other bridegroom ever looked as he did&mdash;so bent up to a purpose, so grimly resolute: or who, under such steadfast brows, ever revealed such flaming and flashing eyes.</p></div> </div>
