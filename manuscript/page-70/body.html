<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Why did they send me so far and so lonely, &nbsp;&nbsp; Up where the moors spread and grey rocks are piled? Men are hard-hearted, and kind angels only &nbsp;&nbsp; Watch o&rsquo;er the steps of a poor orphan child.</p><p>Yet distant and soft the night breeze is blowing, &nbsp;&nbsp; Clouds there are none, and clear stars beam mild, God, in His mercy, protection is showing, &nbsp;&nbsp; Comfort and hope to the poor orphan child.</p><p>Ev&rsquo;n should I fall o&rsquo;er the broken bridge passing, &nbsp;&nbsp; Or stray in the marshes, by false lights beguiled, Still will my Father, with promise and blessing, &nbsp;&nbsp; Take to His bosom the poor orphan child.</p></div> </div>
