<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; Your mind is my treasure, and if it were broken, it would be my treasure still: if you raved, my arms should confine you, and not a strait waistcoat&mdash;your grasp, even in fury, would have a charm for me: if you flew at me as wildly as that woman did this morning, I should receive you in an embrace, at least as fond as it would be restrictive.&nbsp; I should not shrink from you with disgust as I did from her: in your quiet moments you should have no watcher and no nurse but me; and I could hang over you with untiring tenderness, though you gave me no smile in return; and never weary of gazing into your eyes, though they had no longer a ray of recognition for me.&mdash;But why do I follow that train of ideas?&nbsp; I was talking of removing you from Thornfield.&nbsp; All, you know, is prepared for prompt departure: to-morrow you shall go.</p></div> </div>
