<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>There was nothing to cool or banish love in these circumstances, though much to create despair.&nbsp; Much too, you will think, reader, to engender jealousy: if a woman, in my position, could presume to be jealous of a woman in Miss Ingram&rsquo;s.&nbsp; But I was not jealous: or very rarely;&mdash;the nature of the pain I suffered could not be explained by that word.&nbsp; Miss Ingram was a mark beneath jealousy: she was too inferior to excite the feeling.&nbsp; Pardon the seeming paradox; I mean what I say.&nbsp; She was very showy, but she was not genuine: she had a fine person, many brilliant attainments; but her mind was poor, her heart barren by nature: nothing bloomed spontaneously on that soil; no unforced natural fruit delighted by its freshness.&nbsp; She was not good; she was not original: she used to repeat sounding phrases from books: she never offered, nor had, an opinion of her own.</p></div> </div>
