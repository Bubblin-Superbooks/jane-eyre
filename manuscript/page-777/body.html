<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Two young ladies appeared before me; one very tall, almost as tall as Miss Ingram&mdash;very thin too, with a sallow face and severe mien.&nbsp; There was something ascetic in her look, which was augmented by the extreme plainness of a straight-skirted, black, stuff dress, a starched linen collar, hair combed away from the temples, and the nun-like ornament of a string of ebony beads and a crucifix.&nbsp; This I felt sure was Eliza, though I could trace little resemblance to her former self in that elongated and colourless visage.</p><p>The other was as certainly Georgiana: but not the Georgiana I remembered&mdash;the slim and fairy-like girl of eleven.&nbsp; This was a full-blown, very plump damsel, fair as waxwork, with handsome and regular features, languishing blue eyes, and ringleted yellow hair.</p></div> </div>
