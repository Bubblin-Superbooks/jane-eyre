<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>I hardly know whether I had slept or not after this musing; at any rate, I started wide awake on hearing a vague murmur, peculiar and lugubrious, which sounded, I thought, just above me.&nbsp; I wished I had kept my candle burning: the night was drearily dark; my spirits were depressed.&nbsp; I rose and sat up in bed, listening.&nbsp; The sound was hushed.</p><p>I tried again to sleep; but my heart beat anxiously: my inward tranquillity was broken.&nbsp; The clock, far down in the hall, struck two.&nbsp; Just then it seemed my chamber-door was touched; as if fingers had swept the panels in groping a way along the dark gallery outside.&nbsp; I said, &ldquo;Who is there?&rdquo;&nbsp; Nothing answered.&nbsp; I was chilled with fear.</p></div> </div>
