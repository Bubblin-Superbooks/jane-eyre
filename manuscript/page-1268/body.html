<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The translation of a few pages of German occupied an hour; then I got my palette and pencils, and fell to the more soothing, because easier occupation, of completing Rosamond Oliver&rsquo;s miniature.&nbsp; The head was finished already: there was but the background to tint and the drapery to shade off; a touch of carmine, too, to add to the ripe lips&mdash;a soft curl here and there to the tresses&mdash;a deeper tinge to the shadow of the lash under the azured eyelid.&nbsp; I was absorbed in the execution of these nice details, when, after one rapid tap, my door unclosed, admitting St. John Rivers.</p><p>&ldquo;I am come to see how you are spending your holiday,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Not, I hope, in thought?&nbsp; No, that is well: while you draw you will not feel lonely.&nbsp; You see, I mistrust you still, though you have borne up wonderfully so far.</p></div> </div>
