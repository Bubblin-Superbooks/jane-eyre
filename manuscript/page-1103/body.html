<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; From the well-known names of these towns I learn in what county I have lighted; a north-midland shire, dusk with moorland, ridged with mountain: this I see.&nbsp; There are great moors behind and on each hand of me; there are waves of mountains far beyond that deep valley at my feet.&nbsp; The population here must be thin, and I see no passengers on these roads: they stretch out east, west, north, and south&mdash;white, broad, lonely; they are all cut in the moor, and the heather grows deep and wild to their very verge.&nbsp; Yet a chance traveller might pass by; and I wish no eye to see me now: strangers would wonder what I am doing, lingering here at the sign-post, evidently objectless and lost.&nbsp; I might be questioned: I could give no answer but what would sound incredible and excite suspicion.</p></div> </div>
