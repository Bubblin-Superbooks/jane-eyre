<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Some time passed before I felt tranquil even here: I had a vague dread that wild cattle might be near, or that some sportsman or poacher might discover me.&nbsp; If a gust of wind swept the waste, I looked up, fearing it was the rush of a bull; if a plover whistled, I imagined it a man.&nbsp; Finding my apprehensions unfounded, however, and calmed by the deep silence that reigned as evening declined at nightfall, I took confidence.&nbsp; As yet I had not thought; I had only listened, watched, dreaded; now I regained the faculty of reflection.</p><p>What was I to do?&nbsp; Where to go?&nbsp; Oh, intolerable questions, when I could do nothing and go nowhere!&mdash;when a long way must yet be measured by my weary, trembling limbs before I could reach human habitation&mdash;</p></div> </div>
