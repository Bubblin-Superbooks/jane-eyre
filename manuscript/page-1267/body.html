<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; I have brought you a book for evening solace,&rdquo; and he laid on the table a new publication&mdash;a poem: one of those genuine productions so often vouchsafed to the fortunate public of those days&mdash;the golden age of modern literature.&nbsp; Alas! the readers of our era are less favoured.&nbsp; But courage!&nbsp; I will not pause either to accuse or repine.&nbsp; I know poetry is not dead, nor genius lost; nor has Mammon gained power over either, to bind or slay: they will both assert their existence, their presence, their liberty and strength again one day.&nbsp; Powerful angels, safe in heaven! they smile when sordid souls triumph, and feeble ones weep over their destruction.&nbsp; Poetry destroyed?&nbsp; Genius banished?&nbsp; No!&nbsp; Mediocrity, no: do not let envy prompt you to the thought.</p></div> </div>
