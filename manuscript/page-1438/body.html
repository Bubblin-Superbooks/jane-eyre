<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>I broke from St. John, who had followed, and would have detained me.&nbsp; It was my time to assume ascendency.&nbsp; My powers were in play and in force.&nbsp; I told him to forbear question or remark; I desired him to leave me: I must and would be alone.&nbsp; He obeyed at once.&nbsp; Where there is energy to command well enough, obedience never fails.&nbsp; I mounted to my chamber; locked myself in; fell on my knees; and prayed in my way&mdash;a different way to St. John&rsquo;s, but effective in its own fashion.&nbsp; I seemed to penetrate very near a Mighty Spirit; and my soul rushed out in gratitude at His feet.&nbsp; I rose from the thanksgiving&mdash;took a resolve&mdash;and lay down, unscared, enlightened&mdash;eager but for the daylight.</p></div> </div>
