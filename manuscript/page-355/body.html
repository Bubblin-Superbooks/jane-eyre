<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>This was all the account I got from Mrs. Fairfax of her employer and mine.&nbsp; There are people who seem to have no notion of sketching a character, or observing and describing salient points, either in persons or things: the good lady evidently belonged to this class; my queries puzzled, but did not draw her out.&nbsp; Mr. Rochester was Mr. Rochester in her eyes; a gentleman, a landed proprietor&mdash;nothing more: she inquired and searched no further, and evidently wondered at my wish to gain a more definite notion of his identity.</p><p>When we left the dining-room, she proposed to show me over the rest of the house; and I followed her upstairs and downstairs, admiring as I went; for all was well arranged and handsome.&nbsp; The large front chambers I thought especially grand: and some of the third-storey rooms, though dark and low, were interesting from their air of antiquity.</p></div> </div>
