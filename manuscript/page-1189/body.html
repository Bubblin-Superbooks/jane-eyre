<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; I observed but two points in planning my departure&mdash;speed, secrecy: to secure these, I had to leave behind me everything I possessed except a small parcel; which, in my hurry and trouble of mind, I forgot to take out of the coach that brought me to Whitcross.&nbsp; To this neighbourhood, then, I came, quite destitute.&nbsp; I slept two nights in the open air, and wandered about two days without crossing a threshold: but twice in that space of time did I taste food; and it was when brought by hunger, exhaustion, and despair almost to the last gasp, that you, Mr. Rivers, forbade me to perish of want at your door, and took me under the shelter of your roof.&nbsp; I know all your sisters have done for me since&mdash;for I have not been insensible during my seeming torpor&mdash;and I owe to their spontaneous, genuine, genial compassion as large a debt as to your evangelical charity.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
