<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; I came into this room, and the sight of the empty chair and fireless hearth chilled me.&nbsp; For some time after I went to bed, I could not sleep&mdash;a sense of anxious excitement distressed me.&nbsp; The gale still rising, seemed to my ear to muffle a mournful under-sound; whether in the house or abroad I could not at first tell, but it recurred, doubtful yet doleful at every lull; at last I made out it must be some dog howling at a distance.&nbsp; I was glad when it ceased.&nbsp; On sleeping, I continued in dreams the idea of a dark and gusty night.&nbsp; I continued also the wish to be with you, and experienced a strange, regretful consciousness of some barrier dividing us.&nbsp; During all my first sleep, I was following the windings of an unknown road; total obscurity environed me; rain pelted me;</p></div> </div>
