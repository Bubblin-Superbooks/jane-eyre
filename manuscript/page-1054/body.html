<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; I saw hope revive&mdash;and felt regeneration possible.&nbsp; From a flowery arch at the bottom of my garden I gazed over the sea&mdash;bluer than the sky: the old world was beyond; clear prospects opened thus:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Go,&rsquo; said Hope, &lsquo;and live again in Europe: there it is not known what a sullied name you bear, nor what a filthy burden is bound to you.&nbsp; You may take the maniac with you to England; confine her with due attendance and precautions at Thornfield: then travel yourself to what clime you will, and form what new tie you like.&nbsp; That woman, who has so abused your long-suffering, so sullied your name, so outraged your honour, so blighted your youth, is not your wife, nor are you her husband.&nbsp; See that she is cared for as her condition demands, and you have done all that God and humanity require of you.</p></div> </div>
