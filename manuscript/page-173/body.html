<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; &ldquo;How can she bear it so quietly&mdash;so firmly?&rdquo; I asked of myself.&nbsp; &ldquo;Were I in her place, it seems to me I should wish the earth to open and swallow me up.&nbsp; She looks as if she were thinking of something beyond her punishment&mdash;beyond her situation: of something not round her nor before her.&nbsp; I have heard of day-dreams&mdash;is she in a day-dream now?&nbsp; Her eyes are fixed on the floor, but I am sure they do not see it&mdash;her sight seems turned in, gone down into her heart: she is looking at what she can remember, I believe; not at what is really present.&nbsp; I wonder what sort of a girl she is&mdash;whether good or naughty.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
