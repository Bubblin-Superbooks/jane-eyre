<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Sweet-briar and southernwood, jasmine, pink, and rose have long been yielding their evening sacrifice of incense: this new scent is neither of shrub nor flower; it is&mdash;I know it well&mdash;it is Mr. Rochester&rsquo;s cigar.&nbsp; I look round and I listen.&nbsp; I see trees laden with ripening fruit.&nbsp; I hear a nightingale warbling in a wood half a mile off; no moving form is visible, no coming step audible; but that perfume increases: I must flee.&nbsp; I make for the wicket leading to the shrubbery, and I see Mr. Rochester entering.&nbsp; I step aside into the ivy recess; he will not stay long: he will soon return whence he came, and if I sit still he will never see me.</p></div> </div>
