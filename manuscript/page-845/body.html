<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>It was now the sweetest hour of the twenty-four:&mdash;&ldquo;Day its fervid fires had wasted,&rdquo; and dew fell cool on panting plain and scorched summit.&nbsp; Where the sun had gone down in simple state&mdash;pure of the pomp of clouds&mdash;spread a solemn purple, burning with the light of red jewel and furnace flame at one point, on one hill-peak, and extending high and wide, soft and still softer, over half heaven.&nbsp; The east had its own charm or fine deep blue, and its own modest gem, a casino and solitary star: soon it would boast the moon; but she was yet beneath the horizon.</p><p>I walked a while on the pavement; but a subtle, well-known scent&mdash;that of a cigar&mdash;stole from some window; I saw the library casement open a handbreadth; I knew I might be watched thence; so I went apart into the orchard.</p></div> </div>
