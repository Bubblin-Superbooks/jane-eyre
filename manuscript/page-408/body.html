<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Here is Miss Eyre, sir,&rdquo; said Mrs. Fairfax, in her quiet way.&nbsp; He bowed, still not taking his eyes from the group of the dog and child.</p><p>&ldquo;Let Miss Eyre be seated,&rdquo; said he: and there was something in the forced stiff bow, in the impatient yet formal tone, which seemed further to express, &ldquo;What the deuce is it to me whether Miss Eyre be there or not?&nbsp; At this moment I am not disposed to accost her.&rdquo;</p><p>I sat down quite disembarrassed.&nbsp; A reception of finished politeness would probably have confused me: I could not have returned or repaid it by answering grace and elegance on my part; but harsh caprice laid me under no obligation; on the contrary, a decent quiescence, under the freak of manner, gave me the advantage.&nbsp; Besides, the eccentricity of the proceeding was piquant: I felt interested to see how he would go on.</p></div> </div>
