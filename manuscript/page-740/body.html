<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> conceive that you there commit a capital error, no matter of what nature or from what motives, but one whose consequences must follow you through life and taint all your existence.&nbsp; Mind, I don&rsquo;t say a crime; I am not speaking of shedding of blood or any other guilty act, which might make the perpetrator amenable to the law: my word is error.&nbsp; The results of what you have done become in time to you utterly insupportable; you take measures to obtain relief: unusual measures, but neither unlawful nor culpable.&nbsp; Still you are miserable; for hope has quitted you on the very confines of life: your sun at noon darkens in an eclipse, which you feel will not leave it till the time of setting.&nbsp; Bitter and base associations have become the sole food of your memory: you wander here and there, seeking rest in exile: happiness in pleasure&mdash;I mean in heartless, sensual pleasure&mdash;</p></div> </div>
