<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; I was a fool both times.&nbsp; To have yielded then would have been an error of principle; to have yielded now would have been an error of judgment.&nbsp; So I think at this hour, when I look back to the crisis through the quiet medium of time: I was unconscious of folly at the instant.</p><p>I stood motionless under my hierophant&rsquo;s touch.&nbsp; My refusals were forgotten&mdash;my fears overcome&mdash;my wrestlings paralysed.&nbsp; The Impossible&mdash;i.e., my marriage with St. John&mdash;was fast becoming the Possible.&nbsp; All was changing utterly with a sudden sweep.&nbsp; Religion called&mdash;Angels beckoned&mdash;God commanded&mdash;life rolled together like a scroll&mdash;death&rsquo;s gates opening, showed eternity beyond: it seemed, that for safety and bliss there, all here might be sacrificed in a second.&nbsp; The dim room was full of visions.</p></div> </div>
