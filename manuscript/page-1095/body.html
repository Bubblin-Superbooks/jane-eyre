<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; But I looked neither to rising sun, nor smiling sky, nor wakening nature.&nbsp; He who is taken out to pass through a fair scene to the scaffold, thinks not of the flowers that smile on his road, but of the block and axe-edge; of the disseverment of bone and vein; of the grave gaping at the end: and I thought of drear flight and homeless wandering&mdash;and oh! with agony I thought of what I left.&nbsp; I could not help it.&nbsp; I thought of him now&mdash;in his room&mdash;watching the sunrise; hoping I should soon come to say I would stay with him and be his.&nbsp; I longed to be his; I panted to return: it was not too late; I could yet spare him the bitter pang of bereavement.&nbsp; As yet my flight, I was sure, was undiscovered.&nbsp; I could go back and be his comforter&mdash;his pride; his redeemer from misery, perhaps from ruin.</p></div> </div>
