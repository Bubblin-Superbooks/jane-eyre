<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Miss Eyre, I repeat it, you can leave me.&nbsp; How often am I to say the same thing?&nbsp; Why do you remain pertinaciously perched on my knee, when I have given you notice to quit?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Because I am comfortable there.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, Jane, you are not comfortable there, because your heart is not with me: it is with this cousin&mdash;this St. John.&nbsp; Oh, till this moment, I thought my little Jane was all mine!&nbsp; I had a belief she loved me even when she left me: that was an atom of sweet in much bitter.&nbsp; Long as we have been parted, hot tears as I have wept over our separation, I never thought that while I was mourning her, she was loving another!&nbsp; But it is useless grieving.&nbsp; Jane, leave me: go and marry Rivers.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
