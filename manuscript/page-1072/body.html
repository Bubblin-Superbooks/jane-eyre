<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; I was an intellectual epicure, and wished to prolong the gratification of making this novel and piquant acquaintance: besides, I was for a while troubled with a haunting fear that if I handled the flower freely its bloom would fade&mdash;the sweet charm of freshness would leave it.&nbsp; I did not then know that it was no transitory blossom, but rather the radiant resemblance of one, cut in an indestructible gem.&nbsp; Moreover, I wished to see whether you would seek me if I shunned you&mdash;but you did not; you kept in the schoolroom as still as your own desk and easel; if by chance I met you, you passed me as soon, and with as little token of recognition, as was consistent with respect.&nbsp; Your habitual expression in those days, Jane, was a thoughtful look; not despondent, for you were not sickly; but not buoyant, for you had little hope, and no actual pleasure.</p></div> </div>
