<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you, if I can, the idea, the picture these words opened to my mind: yet it is difficult to express what I want to express.&nbsp; Ferndean is buried, as you see, in a heavy wood, where sound falls dull, and dies unreverberating.&nbsp; &lsquo;Where are you?&rsquo; seemed spoken amongst mountains; for I heard a hill-sent echo repeat the words.&nbsp; Cooler and fresher at the moment the gale seemed to visit my brow: I could have deemed that in some wild, lone scene, I and Jane were meeting.&nbsp; In spirit, I believe we must have met.&nbsp; You no doubt were, at that hour, in unconscious sleep, Jane: perhaps your soul wandered from its cell to comfort mine; for those were your accents&mdash;as certain as I live&mdash;they were yours!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
