<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Mr. Rochester, it seems, by the surgeon&rsquo;s orders, went to bed early that night; nor did he rise soon next morning.&nbsp; When he did come down, it was to attend to business: his agent and some of his tenants were arrived, and waiting to speak with him.</p><p>Ad&egrave;le and I had now to vacate the library: it would be in daily requisition as a reception-room for callers.&nbsp; A fire was lit in an apartment upstairs, and there I carried our books, and arranged it for the future schoolroom.&nbsp; I discerned in the course of the morning that Thornfield Hall was a changed place: no longer silent as a church, it echoed every hour or two to a knock at the door, or a clang of the bell; steps, too, often traversed the hall, and new voices spoke in different keys below; a rill from the outer world was flowing through it; it had a master: for my part, I liked it better.</p></div> </div>
