<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; I looked at my love: that feeling which was my master&rsquo;s&mdash;which he had created; it shivered in my heart, like a suffering child in a cold cradle; sickness and anguish had seized it; it could not seek Mr. Rochester&rsquo;s arms&mdash;it could not derive warmth from his breast.&nbsp; Oh, never more could it turn to him; for faith was blighted&mdash;confidence destroyed!&nbsp; Mr. Rochester was not to me what he had been; for he was not what I had thought him.&nbsp; I would not ascribe vice to him; I would not say he had betrayed me; but the attribute of stainless truth was gone from his idea, and from his presence I must go: that I perceived well.&nbsp; When&mdash;how&mdash;whither, I could not yet discern; but he himself, I doubted not, would hurry me from Thornfield.</p></div> </div>
