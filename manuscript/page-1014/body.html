<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; One idea only still throbbed life-like within me&mdash;a remembrance of God: it begot an unuttered prayer: these words went wandering up and down in my rayless mind, as something that should be whispered, but no energy was found to express them&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Be not far from me, for trouble is near: there is none to help.&rdquo;</p><p>It was near: and as I had lifted no petition to Heaven to avert it&mdash;as I had neither joined my hands, nor bent my knees, nor moved my lips&mdash;it came: in full heavy swing the torrent poured over me.&nbsp; The whole consciousness of my life lorn, my love lost, my hope quenched, my faith death-struck, swayed full and mighty above me in one sullen mass.&nbsp; That bitter hour cannot be described: in truth, &ldquo;the waters came into my soul; I sank in deep mire: I felt no standing; I came into deep waters; the floods overflowed me.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
