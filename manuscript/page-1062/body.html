<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; Sometimes, for a fleeting moment, I thought I caught a glance, heard a tone, beheld a form, which announced the realisation of my dream: but I was presently undeserved.&nbsp; You are not to suppose that I desired perfection, either of mind or person.&nbsp; I longed only for what suited me&mdash;for the antipodes of the Creole: and I longed vainly.&nbsp; Amongst them all I found not one whom, had I been ever so free, I&mdash;warned as I was of the risks, the horrors, the loathings of incongruous unions&mdash;would have asked to marry me.&nbsp; Disappointment made me reckless.&nbsp; I tried dissipation&mdash;never debauchery: that I hated, and hate.&nbsp; That was my Indian Messalina&rsquo;s attribute: rooted disgust at it and her restrained me much, even in pleasure.&nbsp; Any enjoyment that bordered on riot seemed to approach me to her and her vices, and I eschewed it.</p></div> </div>
