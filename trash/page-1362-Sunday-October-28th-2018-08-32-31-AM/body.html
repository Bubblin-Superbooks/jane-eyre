<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; Diana, who chanced to be in a frolicsome humour (she was not painfully controlled by his will; for hers, in another way, was as strong), exclaimed&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;St. John! you used to call Jane your third sister, but you don&rsquo;t treat her as such: you should kiss her too.&rdquo;</p><p>She pushed me towards him.&nbsp; I thought Diana very provoking, and felt uncomfortably confused; and while I was thus thinking and feeling, St. John bent his head; his Greek face was brought to a level with mine, his eyes questioned my eyes piercingly&mdash;he kissed me.&nbsp; There are no such things as marble kisses or ice kisses, or I should say my ecclesiastical cousin&rsquo;s salute belonged to one of these classes; but there may be experiment kisses, and his was an experiment kiss.</p></div> </div>
