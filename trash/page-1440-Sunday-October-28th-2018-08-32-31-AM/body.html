<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The daylight came.&nbsp; I rose at dawn.&nbsp; I busied myself for an hour or two with arranging my things in my chamber, drawers, and wardrobe, in the order wherein I should wish to leave them during a brief absence.&nbsp; Meantime, I heard St. John quit his room.&nbsp; He stopped at my door: I feared he would knock&mdash;no, but a slip of paper was passed under the door.&nbsp; I took it up.&nbsp; It bore these words&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;You left me too suddenly last night.&nbsp; Had you stayed but a little longer, you would have laid your hand on the Christian&rsquo;s cross and the angel&rsquo;s crown.&nbsp; I shall expect your clear decision when I return this day fortnight.&nbsp; Meantime, watch and pray that you enter not into temptation: the spirit, I trust, is willing, but the flesh, I see, is weak.&nbsp; I shall pray for you hourly.&mdash;Yours, St. John.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
