<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>One day I had come to my studies in lower spirits than usual; the ebb was occasioned by a poignantly felt disappointment.&nbsp; Hannah had told me in the morning there was a letter for me, and when I went down to take it, almost certain that the long-looked for tidings were vouchsafed me at last, I found only an unimportant note from Mr. Briggs on business.&nbsp; The bitter check had wrung from me some tears; and now, as I sat poring over the crabbed characters and flourishing tropes of an Indian scribe, my eyes filled again.</p><p>St. John called me to his side to read; in attempting to do this my voice failed me: words were lost in sobs.&nbsp; He and I were the only occupants of the parlour: Diana was practising her music in the drawing-room, Mary was gardening&mdash;it was a very fine May day, clear, sunny, and breezy.</p></div> </div>
