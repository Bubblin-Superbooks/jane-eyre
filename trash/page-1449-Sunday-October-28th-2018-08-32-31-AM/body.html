<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; There was the stile before me&mdash;the very fields through which I had hurried, blind, deaf, distracted with a revengeful fury tracking and scourging me, on the morning I fled from Thornfield: ere I well knew what course I had resolved to take, I was in the midst of them.&nbsp; How fast I walked!&nbsp; How I ran sometimes!&nbsp; How I looked forward to catch the first view of the well-known woods!&nbsp; With what feelings I welcomed single trees I knew, and familiar glimpses of meadow and hill between them!</p><p>At last the woods rose; the rookery clustered dark; a loud cawing broke the morning stillness.&nbsp; Strange delight inspired me: on I hastened.&nbsp; Another field crossed&mdash;a lane threaded&mdash;and there were the courtyard walls&mdash;the back offices: the house itself, the rookery still hid.</p></div> </div>
