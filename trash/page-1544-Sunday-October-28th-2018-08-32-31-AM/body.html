<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; Diana announced that she would just give me time to get over the honeymoon, and then she would come and see me.</p><p>&ldquo;She had better not wait till then, Jane,&rdquo; said Mr. Rochester, when I read her letter to him; &ldquo;if she does, she will be too late, for our honeymoon will shine our life long: its beams will only fade over your grave or mine.&rdquo;</p><p>How St. John received the news, I don&rsquo;t know: he never answered the letter in which I communicated it: yet six months after he wrote to me, without, however, mentioning Mr. Rochester&rsquo;s name or alluding to my marriage.&nbsp; His letter was then calm, and, though very serious, kind.&nbsp; He has maintained a regular, though not frequent, correspondence ever since: he hopes I am happy, and trusts I am not of those who live without God in the world, and only mind earthly things.</p></div> </div>
