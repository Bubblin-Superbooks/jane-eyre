<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;I conscientiously believe so, Mr. Rochester.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yet how, on this dark and doleful evening, could you so suddenly rise on my lone hearth?&nbsp; I stretched my hand to take a glass of water from a hireling, and it was given me by you: I asked a question, expecting John&rsquo;s wife to answer me, and your voice spoke at my ear.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Because I had come in, in Mary&rsquo;s stead, with the tray.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And there is enchantment in the very hour I am now spending with you.&nbsp; Who can tell what a dark, dreary, hopeless life I have dragged on for months past?&nbsp; Doing nothing, expecting nothing; merging night in day; feeling but the sensation of cold when I let the fire go out, of hunger when I forgot to eat: and then a ceaseless sorrow, and, at times, a very delirium of desire to behold my Jane again.</p></div> </div>
