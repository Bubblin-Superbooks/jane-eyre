<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; In leaving England, I should leave a loved but empty land&mdash;Mr. Rochester is not there; and if he were, what is, what can that ever be to me?&nbsp; My business is to live without him now: nothing so absurd, so weak as to drag on from day to day, as if I were waiting some impossible change in circumstances, which might reunite me to him.&nbsp; Of course (as St. John once said) I must seek another interest in life to replace the one lost: is not the occupation he now offers me truly the most glorious man can adopt or God assign?&nbsp; Is it not, by its noble cares and sublime results, the one best calculated to fill the void left by uptorn affections and demolished hopes?&nbsp; I believe I must say, Yes&mdash;and yet I shudder.&nbsp; Alas!&nbsp; If I join St. John, I abandon half myself: if I go to India, I go to premature death.</p></div> </div>
