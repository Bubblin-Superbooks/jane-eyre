<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> for when Mrs. Poole was fast asleep after the gin and water, the mad lady, who was as cunning as a witch, would take the keys out of her pocket, let herself out of her chamber, and go roaming about the house, doing any wild mischief that came into her head.&nbsp; They say she had nearly burnt her husband in his bed once: but I don&rsquo;t know about that.&nbsp; However, on this night, she set fire first to the hangings of the room next her own, and then she got down to a lower storey, and made her way to the chamber that had been the governess&rsquo;s&mdash;(she was like as if she knew somehow how matters had gone on, and had a spite at her)&mdash;and she kindled the bed there; but there was nobody sleeping in it, fortunately.</p></div> </div>
