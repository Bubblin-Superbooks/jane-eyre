<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; The wondrous shock of feeling had come like the earthquake which shook the foundations of Paul and Silas&rsquo;s prison; it had opened the doors of the soul&rsquo;s cell and loosed its bands&mdash;it had wakened it out of its sleep, whence it sprang trembling, listening, aghast; then vibrated thrice a cry on my startled ear, and in my quaking heart and through my spirit, which neither feared nor shook, but exulted as if in joy over the success of one effort it had been privileged to make, independent of the cumbrous body.</p><p>&ldquo;Ere many days,&rdquo; I said, as I terminated my musings, &ldquo;I will know something of him whose voice seemed last night to summon me.&nbsp; Letters have proved of no avail&mdash;personal inquiry shall replace them.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
