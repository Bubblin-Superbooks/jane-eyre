<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>All the house was still; for I believe all, except St. John and myself, were now retired to rest.&nbsp; The one candle was dying out: the room was full of moonlight.&nbsp; My heart beat fast and thick: I heard its throb.&nbsp; Suddenly it stood still to an inexpressible feeling that thrilled it through, and passed at once to my head and extremities.&nbsp; The feeling was not like an electric shock, but it was quite as sharp, as strange, as startling: it acted on my senses as if their utmost activity hitherto had been but torpor, from which they were now summoned and forced to wake.&nbsp; They rose expectant: eye and ear waited while the flesh quivered on my bones.</p></div> </div>
