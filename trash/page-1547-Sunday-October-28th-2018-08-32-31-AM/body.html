<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>I have now been married ten years.&nbsp; I know what it is to live entirely for and with what I love best on earth.&nbsp; I hold myself supremely blest&mdash;blest beyond what language can express; because I am my husband&rsquo;s life as fully as he is mine.&nbsp; No woman was ever nearer to her mate than I am: ever more absolutely bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh.&nbsp; I know no weariness of my Edward&rsquo;s society: he knows none of mine, any more than we each do of the pulsation of the heart that beats in our separate bosoms; consequently, we are ever together.&nbsp; To be together is for us to be at once as free as in solitude, as gay as in company.&nbsp; We talk, I believe, all day long: to talk to each other is but a more animated and an audible thinking.</p></div> </div>
