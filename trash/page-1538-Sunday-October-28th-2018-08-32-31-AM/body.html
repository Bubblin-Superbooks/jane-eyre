<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Reader, it was on Monday night&mdash;near midnight&mdash;that I too had received the mysterious summons: those were the very words by which I replied to it.&nbsp; I listened to Mr. Rochester&rsquo;s narrative, but made no disclosure in return.&nbsp; The coincidence struck me as too awful and inexplicable to be communicated or discussed.&nbsp; If I told anything, my tale would be such as must necessarily make a profound impression on the mind of my hearer: and that mind, yet from its sufferings too prone to gloom, needed not the deeper shade of the supernatural.&nbsp; I kept these things then, and pondered them in my heart.</p><p>&ldquo;You cannot now wonder,&rdquo; continued my master, &ldquo;that when you rose upon me so unexpectedly last night, I had difficulty in believing you any other than a mere voice and vision, something that would melt to silence and annihilation, as the midnight whisper and mountain echo had melted before.&nbsp; Now, I thank God!&nbsp; I know it to be otherwise.&nbsp; Yes, I thank God!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
