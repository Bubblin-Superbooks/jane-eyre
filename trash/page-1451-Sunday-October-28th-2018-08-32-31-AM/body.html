<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>I had coasted along the lower wall of the orchard&mdash;turned its angle: there was a gate just there, opening into the meadow, between two stone pillars crowned by stone balls.&nbsp; From behind one pillar I could peep round quietly at the full front of the mansion.&nbsp; I advanced my head with precaution, desirous to ascertain if any bedroom window-blinds were yet drawn up: battlements, windows, long front&mdash;all from this sheltered station were at my command.</p><p>The crows sailing overhead perhaps watched me while I took this survey.&nbsp; I wonder what they thought.&nbsp; They must have considered I was very careful and timid at first, and that gradually I grew very bold and reckless.&nbsp; A peep, and then a long stare; and then a departure from my niche and a straying out into the meadow; and a sudden stop full in front of the great mansion, and a protracted, hardy gaze towards it.</p></div> </div>
